Question,Answer
"Q: We're...we're on. The camera's starting. Would you tell me your full name, please?",A: My name is Leo Schneiderman.
"Q: Where were you born, and when? Q: Leo, tell me about your childhood. I want to know about your family first.","A: Well, my family, uh, was...I had, uh...two brothers and a sister. My father owned a very small store in Poland for supplies, uh, shoemaker supplies. We were not considered on the poverty level, but, uh, we were comfortable before the war. I went to a private Jewish school, because my parents believed in, uh, a Jewish education--but secular, not religious. We were never strictly religious; but I would call ourselves traditional Jews.When the war broke out, uh, I was eighteen years old."
Q: Let's talk a little bit more before the war. I want to know something.,A: Uh huh.
"Q: Tell me about...what was Lodz like, pre-Hitler?","A: Well, Lodz was a industrial city, about the second largest city in Poland. It was...it had a large Jewish population. I'd say about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Jews used to live in Poland [NB: in Lodz]. Uh, most of the Jews were concentrated in uh...in one area.It was voluntarily, because they...they like just to live.... It was just, I would call it, a voluntary ghetto; because they like to, to stick to each other. They...they had a cultural life. There were three Jewish theaters, three daily newspapers. It was a publishing house.It was Jewish schools, which I attended one of them. It was also a very active religious life and a political life. Uh, it was swarming with the unions and, uh, political parties. It was really a bustling Jewish life, in the city of Lodz. A lot...most of the Jews were in textile industry. Uh, many of them, uh, used to take out work from the factories, and they did it at home; and by the end of the week they'd put it back together and they'd send it in. It was those...uh weavers, hand weavers, mostly. It was a large industry in...in Poland.After I finished school, you know, for a Jewish young kid, it was uh.... In, in our class, I could not afford any higher education. I went to learn a trade, as an apprentice.What...[some (ph)] went as weavers, tailors, shoemakers. Well, I choose to be a tailor; and for a few years I worked as an apprentice even without getting paid. Just for thebenefit to learn the trade. And later on, I start to make a little money. And then come the war. War broke out, I was about eighteen years old."
"Q: Alright. Tell me what happened the day the war broke out. Q: Leo, tell...tell me about a day in your life. What was it like for Leo Schneiderman?",A: During the war?
"Q: Tell me what you did, and what your family did?","A: OK. When we get up in the morning, all four of us, we had to prepare for work. | start off with...with my mother. My mother worked at a...at the place where they used to, to, to...fuel, to distribute the fuel for the house. Coal. It's a.... So she had to go to work in order to get that pot of soup. My sister went to work in a...in a...a place where they used to make shoes out of straw; used for the German army on the front, so when they stood guard they shouldn't freeze their feet. So those big shoes she used to make out of straw.My little brother worked in uh one of the tailor shops, in the office; he was a runner. And I went to work as a tailor in the factory for uniforms. When we came to work in the morning, we start...we started uh by...by the machines, of course, and we were making the German uniforms. But uh the minute I sat down, un...until we finish, that's all it was in my mind at that time is twelve o'clock when we will go, we'll have a break and we'll get something to eat. Because I was constantly hungry. The...the hunger didn't leave me, because the little food that we had at home uh in, in the morning--it was one piece of bread that I ate in the morning, and the se...the other piece I took with me to have it in the shop. And L...I kept it in my pocket, or I kept it in in the pot that I took with me for the...for the soup. Everybody had a little pot with them. And we could not wait; and this was everybody. The whole day, it was in my mind. In the meantime, work has to be done.It was strictly controlled. And twelve o'clock, the minute we have the break we have to...everybody was running for the soup. This was the major event in the...in the day. After work, we came home. Uh if it was summer, it was bearable. In the wintertime, it was no fuel. It was cold. Uh, most of the furniture was gone already because we break, broke it up and burned it just to keep warm. And the minute we were ready with that little supper that we had from the...we, we finished it all together. And then we went to bed, to...even just to keep warm. Uh, and this...when it...most of the time uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in bed. The summertime, when it was warm, we used to go out. We also had to go to stay in line for the rations to...to get. And sometimes uh the staying in line meant hours. And me being the...the man of the house, it was up to me; because I would not have my mother standing in line, or my sister or my little brother, but it...it was up to me to...to bring inthe food from the rations. And uh it was very little left for social life. Me being eighteen, nineteen year old--for some people this is the golden age. Uh, I spent my eighteen and nineteen and twenty years in...in the ghetto of Lodz. Always hungry, always tired, uh overworked, and with no hope for the...for the future. I didn't see any hope. Later, after a few years, I got involved in...in, in some educational project. We started to...to write. I particular was interested in writing something about the ghetto. And I developed some...people say that I did develop some talent for poetry, which later on it was used by some Jewish dramatists like [Jonah Stogow (ph)]. I was also at one time involved in teaching Yiddish, because I was a student of the Yiddish school in...in Lodz, of the [Medem (ph) school. And we taught. It was...this was illegal. It was not allowed to teach. My students were not the children, actually. It was young uh girls--uh, at the age of fifteen, sixteen-- who were interested in knowing, because before the war they went to Polish school and Yiddish was strange to them. In the ghetto, they got that chance. They considered this part of the social life; and also beneficially, because they learned a language. And to me, it was very rewarding, very satisfactory for a while. And for the...for a few years, actually, I did that kind of teaching in Yiddish."
Q: You told me before about a particular man in the ghetto who was particularly cruel.,"A: Yeah. Uh it was one German guard. He took some pleasure in abusing people physically.It was a part of the ghetto where you used to cross from one...from one side to the other, under guard. And this man many times stood there at those gates. And uh if he didn't like somebody, or he went too fast, or he didn't take off his hat in the right way, or he'd walked too slow, he went over to him (cough) and he punched him several times. And that's how (cough) he got the name of ""The Boxer,"" because he used to box people. I looked at that man several times, and somehow he registered in mine brain. At one time-- it was in 1942, before that action that we used to call the ""Sperre"" [Translation: ""Closing,"" ""Closure"" (Ger)], that we were ordered for eight days not to leave the house and they selected all the people that got too weak to work anymore. The children--it were illegal to have children in...in the ghetto. The sick, the olderly [NB: elderly], that they considered useless people. But that...before this action actually started, they...they...all of a sudden, they attacked the ghetto. They came in like a surprise, and they surrounded the hospital. And like wildfire the news spread that the Germans surrounded the hospital on Lagowniecka Street. Before the war, this used to be the ...the....also a ""ambulance""--like social...social medicine station [NB: perhaps ""ambulatorium"" (Pol), an outpatient facility of a hospital]. Kasa Chorych [NB: former National Health Service]. And we run over there. It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that hospital; because he had an attack, they took him to that hospital. And when I heard, the first name that came to my mind, ""Oh, my God, Josek Feldman is in the hospital!"" And I run over and stood there. I still had an hour before going to work, so I stood there for the hour and watched.What I saw, it's hard to describe, even. Wagons standing below the building, and nurses bringing out the patients and put them on the wagons. Uh some patients going on themselves; like uh I saw them, they're going to the wagon. And then I saw from thesecond floor, they opened the window and people were throwing out sick people into the wagons. And who is there conducting the whole operation? That ""Boxer""! Well, after the war at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me, that the the.... It was to the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that ""Boxer."" Of course, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in Chicago and I was told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...in that day. I said, ""I certainly do."" I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to Germany and I testified against that ""Boxer,"" which I found out that his real name is ""Krisom"" because that's how they referred to him, ""Herr Krisom."" And I was asked by the prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that hospital, what's happened in that...in that day. Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I know for sure that the people were thrown out from the windows into the wagon. He said how do I know for sure they were thrown out? Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when they saw the troops. They jumped out by themselves. So my question to him was, ""How about the stretchers?"" People on stretchers. And also: belongings, packages, suitcases, bottles. Altogether were thrown out into the.... And then another question was put to me: ""Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with that ""Boxer,"" that you call him, around? Weren't you afraid to stand there? You told me that he used to beat up people he didn't like."" So I told them that I think that they wanted us to stay. If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away. They want us to stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did. Then the only defense was, from the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else. They never denied that such action happened there by the hospital. The only defense was: maybe it was somebody else, not him. And sure enough, this was forty years later. I said, ""Looking at that man I don't know if this is the man. I only know the ""Boxer."" And if he was the ""Boxer,"" he was the man."" They showed me pictures from the past. I recognized him immediately. And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked his uniform. I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one.And then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it was a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the orders. But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one that we called ""The Boxer""--was in charge of that operation."
Q: When and where was this trial?,"A: The trial was in Bochum (Westphalia), West Germany. It was outside of Diisseldorf. It was in 1978. I don't recall the exact date."
Q: Thank you. Let's go back to the ghetto in Ledz.,A: Yeah. Yeah.
Q: Are there any other stories or incidents that you remember from Lodz that are important that you want to tell us?,"A: Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the transports, we were trying to stay in the ghetto, not to go away. Because to go away to nowhere, to a unknown destination, it's frightening. We don't know where. They..."
"Q: Tell us...excuse me, what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the ghetto, so we know.","A: Yes. The the people from the ghetto was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred, thousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different place. That they need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong men and they put them to work, and they send them away. For a while, their families used to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the ghetto-- to make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is getting. But after a while, it stopped. There were no more letters. No more money. We didn't hear about them; like they were gone. And a few months later another resettlement program. They took away other people. They need another five hundred, or six hundred, or...or a thousand. It was little by little. The ghetto was getting smaller and smaller. The population dying, and putting...and sending away. Until it came to a point that everybody, the whole ghetto, is being liquidated. And everybody was going away. And ..and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay. We hide. We built even uh hiding places underneath, uh underneath cellars. We...we kept on running; because uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the ghetto from there, that there's no place left for a Jew to run. They even promised us that that we were going away we can take our tools. We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new place. But the question was: What is wrong with this place? Why, why do we have to be a new place? Our...this is not paradise that we are here. They promised us a huge amount of food at the train for three days. Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread. This was a treasure. It was like a bait. But still we were...we would like to stay in one place, because one precious thing was left to us--the family was together. And this we felt, it's going to be...the minute we go on the train, we're going to be separated. The men probably will go to work someplace else. We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the men will work in one place. The women will work in another place, and the...the youngsters will work someplace else. This alone was frightening for us. And it came to a point uh that they used to hunt there from street to street. And transport was formed every day, and going to the train and sent away. People among us working at those transports, they told us what is going on at the train and how the people are packed in those trains.Unhuman conditions. And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work, and that's how you transport people going to work? And it was...it became clear that this is the end. And we used to run as much as we could and hide, to avoid those transport going away. It came to a point when our part of the ghetto was sealed off; and it was no more place to hide and no more strength to run. And if one member of the family gives up, the rest follow. My mother told us she cannot run no more. This is it. She would like to go to the train, and get at least a loaf of bread and go away. Lets happen what's happen.Then she suggested that maybe I should keep on hiding with my little brother, and she with my sister would go with them. The minute she said that, my kid brother grabbed my mother's hand and start to cry. He said, ""No, I'm going with you, too."" At that moment we all decided that we shall go together. Either we're going to live together, or we're going to die together. We reported to the train depot. We came there. It was a huge crowd. The boxcars were waiting; and uh German troops, armed guards all around us. Some even had dogs on their leashes. And they divided groups of a hundred...a hundred to each boxcar, and we started to go to train. And sure everybody received a loaf of bread. Two kilo, will be around four pounds of bread. We never had so much bread since the war started. A lot of people started to eat even before they boarded the box car. You know, they start tearing the bread apart and eating. And in an hour when we all were in...in that box car, a hundred of them, he came over-- the one with the dog came over--and looked around, and he took some people from the other group and added to our train; because he felt that we have too much room. And this was in August 1944. It was a very hot day at that time.And after he added the other people, then they put those gates together and we heard that big noise that he locked the boxcar. And there we were in that train, over a hundred people. The only facility in the train was two buckets for over a hundred men, women and children; and the train was standing on one place. It was unbearable hot. Lack of air.So some people had an idea that the minute we start moving, it's going to get cooler.(Cough) But at one moment we heard that the gate opened up in the boxcar, so we thought maybe they changed their mind. They're going to leave us out. But instead, they brought a few dozen Jews discovered in a hiding place; they were all badly beaten up because they were hiding. I remember one young man, all his front teeth were kicked out.And one boy's face was so badly swollen, it was just a nose that we could see--no eyes.And they added to our car. And soon we started to move. It didn't cool off. And at one moment, we heard a young teenage girl crying. She had to go to the buckets in front of everybody. Her mother, her sister tried to shield her with a coat. A man was begging the people around to give a little more room his pregnant wife. Me being among the youngsters, I was asked to climb up those packages, and look out to see where are we going. I start to reading signs. One recognized those names. He said that we are moving south towards Krakow. I also saw some Polish peasants lining the road. They were probably used to those scenes, those trains. Some made signs to us, pointing to the sky.And some went with the fingers across this throat, the throat. I didn't tell the people what I saw; but I mentioned that later on, after the war, to the Polish alderman in Chicago, Mr.Roman [Pochinsky (ph)]. And he told me that, ""They tried to warn you that you going to be killed, that you should try to run away."" Well, I tried to believe that; but the expression on their faces told me something else. It was late at night that we arrived at Auschwitz. When we came in, the minute the gates [NB: the doors of the train] opened up, we heard screams, barking of dogs, blows from...from those kapos--those officials working for them, over the head. And then we got out of the train, and everything went so fast: left, right, right, left. Men separated from women, children torn from the arms of mothers, the olderly chased like cattle. The sick, the disabled, were handled like packs of garbage. They were thrown in a side together with broken suitcases and with boxes. My mother run over to me and grabbed me by the shoulders, and she told me, ""Leibele, I'mnot going to see you no more. Take care of your brother."" Well, my brother was twelve, thirteen at that time. Ten minutes later, Mengele, the doctor--I didn't know in that time...I saw a handsome looking gentlemen with white gloves--pointed to my little brother to go to the left. And before I realized, he was gone and I didn't see him no more. I didn't know at the time that I was the lucky one; because when I went into the showers, from the shower heads we got water. Other people got poison gas. But when we came out from the showers, the sky was red. The air was filled with smoke and the odor of burning flesh and...and hair. A man went over to those officials, and he asked one of those officials (ph)--he called them the ""kapos""--he asked him about his wife and his little girl. And the man looked him straight in the eye. He said, ""There is no more little girl. There was...there is no more wife."" He said, ""What do you mean? Where they are?"" And he pointed to the chimney with that...that smoke bursting out. ""That's their funeral. Here they go."" Well, the man didn't cry. He didn't scream. He just stood there and stared at that chimney. We all stared at it. We would stay there probably for hours. But we started to be chased into the block, to the barracks where we were marched over. We couldn't even recognize each other. No hair. The hair was shaved off. Dressed in striped uniforms--too small, too big, too large, too short. We all looked like clowns. And then we were welcomed by a speech from one of those kapos. He said, ""You saw that sign that ""Arbeit Macht Frei""? That means ""freedom through labor."" He said, ""Don't make any mistakes.Nobody needs your labor here. You did not come here to work. You came here to be killed. You're just waiting your turn. And remember I don't have any...I don't have to have a reason to kill you, if I want it. So you better do what you're told."" Well, this was the beginning of Auschwitz. Every morning that we went out to be counted, we could feel the crematoriums burning. And that most disgusting odor is the burning of flesh and hair together. I decided to make every effort to do everything I can to go away from Aus... Auschwitz. Because they were forming transport to go away to labor; because Auschwitz itself was an extermination camp, not a labor camp. But for the time being, they...they used to send transport to go for work in labor camps. I didn't succeeded in the beginning, but I... still tried. I still tried. Uh, at one time they asked, ""Who knows, who ever worked in road construction?"" The minute I run over, and I said, ""I did."" He said, ""Where did you work?"" I said, ""Outside of _6d_, when they build the highway."" I never saw any construction worked at all. So they put a few hundred together, and they put us in a site. So we were in the transport. All the rest start to get the tatoos to stay in Auschwitz, their number. And we were put on a transport; and I went to a labor camp outside in Silesia, in a place called Kaltwasser."" Kaltwasser was a labor camp under construction. It was a beautiful area. They were building uh new roads and a small railroad, and that's what we worked. The conditions that time: it was very hard. We didn't have adequate clothes; and starting to get cold in the morning, especially when we stood to be counted. We were freezing. There were no beds in our barracks. They just put uh some straw on the floor, and that how's we slept, in our clothes. And the work was very* Administered by Wiistegiersdorf (subcamp of Gro Rosen). Located at Kreis Glatz, in LowerSilesia. Opened August 1944.hard. But the.... We felt that we were chosen to live. It is not Auschwitz. So we, we consider ourself the lucky ones, that we got away from Auschwitz. The...we did not stay too long in that particular camp; because as work progressed, we were sent to a different camp called Larche."" Was the same work, a continuation of the same work. And, uh, there we also worked at the same thing, but the living conditions were a little better.There were beds already--bunks--and we did receive, uh, warmer clothes. Uh, but fortunately that...that work, in...in that was finished in...in a very short time; and they decided again send us to a different camp, in a place called Wolfsberg.* Uh at that particular camp, I met some people--those officials that knew my family from before the war--and I did get a better job. I worked in the hospital, in the Revier, in that hospital in that camp. And my situation improved a little bit, and so did my physical uh condition improved. And there I stood [NB: stayed] until we could hear the Russian army already approaching. At night we heard cannon sound, and we felt that any day we're going to be liberated."
Q: At this point we need to stop and change tapes.,"A: Yeah. OK.* Administered by Wiistegiersdorf (subcamp of GroB Rosen). Located near Lehmwasser, in LowerSilesia. Opened October 20, 1944.""

Q: OK. You are in uh Larche...,A: ...Larche.
Q: Tell us about...tell us about working in the hospital there.,"A: In the hospital, I worked in a place called Wolfsberg, not Larche. Yeah. Well, uh, people, uh, if they had some minor accident or they got sick, they report to the doctor. Uh, they came in, and the doctor prescribed how many days he can stay in that hospital. Three days, four days. A lot of people, uh, tried to just get in to be away and to get some kind of a rest, and to be away from that hard work. They couldn't take it no more. And some legitimately got sick, and they reported to the hospital. They didn't get any treatment, uh, for anything. They just laid there, just to stay away from work. And after a few days, the doctor decided, ""You're all right now, and you can go."" If somebody got seriously sick, somebody made a report. And every few weeks they came and they took the peo-- German people, you know, the Gestapo, whatever--and they took them away. They said they took them away to a real hospital where they can get better treatment. Actually, they were taken to Auschwitz to the gas chambers. And, for example, uh, people who knew that, uh, they were seriously ill, they tried as much as they could to stay away from the hospital; because the hospital...they know if they happened to be so unlucky and this is a time when the Germans come.... Because they come every once in a while to check on this hospital, and they could tell... They didn't, they didn't care about those people who tried to get away from work for a day or so. Whoever was ill, they were taken away; and they...they said they take them to a hospital to be cured, but this was the end of them. Uh, the end station actually was Auschwitz, or any other extermination camp. My work in that hospital was, uh, to keep order. Uh, in the morning, uh, they come in. I had to count the people, uh, to get them ready to...for inspection; and after...and also the food. I also distribute the food for those people. Uh, in some cases, people who did not work received half of the normal rations. Not in that camp where I worked, but in other camps this was the case. For example, this was the case in the last camp where I was liberated, later on.This was the case that non-working people received half of the rations. But in that camp, uh, where I worked--in Wolfsberg--it was not too bad, you know. But the only thing is...three, four days was the maximum that, uh, a person was allowed to be sick. If there was a serious sickness for longer, they took them away. Uh, at one time, they they came in and they took away almost half of the hospital. Yeah, a lot of people. For example, in our...our barrack where I was, uh, in charge--it was some over eighty people--that they took out about thirty, thirty five people away that they considered actually they were not uh...they were emaciated. They looked so bad. So they took them away. And the rest of the people stood [NB: stayed]; and a lot of people were frightened, and they reported out that they said that they feel better. They want to go out to work already."
Q: Where did you go from here? Tell us.,"A: That was like I said, that we fe...we heard already noise of the...of the Red Army approaching. And at one day the...we were told to assemble, and we started to march on foot. The clothes that we had, it was uh not adequate; because this was February already."" It was cold and snowing; and we were marching on these columns, quite uh...almost eight hundred people at that time, the whole camp. And we were marching through the fields; and uh...there was no food. We marched the first day, until it was dark. We passed a lot of hamlets, a lot of villages. People came out and they looked at us. They were probably used to that scenes already. And when we passed a place uh on the field. There were two huge barns, and that's...that how we stood overnight. In the morning we start marching again, the second day. And also until late at night; and it was no food, only that what we got when we started. It was a loaf of bread, and some uh artificial honey, it was a lump; and that's how we marched through two days. On the third day we were also put in...in barns, very big barns; and that's how we stood one day, and another day. And no food."
"Q: Tell me about liberation, when the soldiers came in.","A: Well, people were crying. People were hugging each other. They climbed up on those tanks. They were sticking to the tanks like flies. And, uh, they...already they realized at that time the enormity of their tragedy. Especially for us Jews. People started to make the preparations to go home. Delegations came in from France, from Russia, from Poland; you know, to get their people together. Nobody came for us. Nobody even was interested what is going to happen to the Jews. We had no homes to go. Our homes were destroyed. There were no Jews. They came, and they explained it to us that ""Soon you will receive some information how to get together."" The Jewish Agency came and want to take us to Palestine. And they were told us Polish Jews, ""You're not even welcome back in Poland."" The French government wanted the Jews to come back, but there were very few. But the bulk of the Jewish population was from Russia, from Poland, from Hungary. Some did go back after the liberation, and some came back to the camps. They said, ""There is no more place for us in our home."" Especially in Poland. A Jew came back, and he said he almost got killed when he tried to reclaim his hou... his house. And we decided to stay there. We established some kind of a Jewish community in Austria, some in Germany or in Italy. I was in Austria. I worked for uh the Jewish Central Committee. My boss was the famous Nazi hunter, Simon Wiesenthal, who headed the political department. Also the documentation center. He published our bulletin, that I was also involved because the Yiddishe [Rundschau (ph?)]. I worked in the cultural department of...in Linz, Austria. Until uh.... By the way, I also met my wife, that I knew from the ghetto, in Austria. We got married and we lived in Linz, where I worked in the Central Committee of the Jews in Austria. Until we emigrated. We received a visa through the HIAS, and we came to the United States. But uh the memories of the Holocaust, from those camps-- especially that one scene that when my mother grabbed me by the shoulders and said, ""I will never see you again,"" that I should take care of my little brother--this stays with me for all those years. And I'm sure it will never leave me."
"Q: Leo, what...besides that memory, what has been the effect of the war on you, of the Holocaust on you?","A: The effect is that I got some, I feel that I have a responsibility to tell the story about the Holocaust. But I never dreamed that a time will come that I will have to convince the people there was such a thing as a Holocaust. Beside all the ...the fact and documentation and witnesses, there are people who denied it, that said there wasn't a Holocaust. This I never thought that I will have to do. I feel some kind of a responsibility towards future generations. I tell... talk to my children about it. A lot of people--friends of mine--tried to spare their children, and their grandchildren, those horrible experiences that they went through. I think it was wrong. I feel that we should make every effort for the world to learn the lesson of the Holocaust, so such an event should never, never happen again. To no people. I'm very sensitive at the misery of other people. Mainly because I'm a Jew, and I know what it means. The Holocaust Museum that is being built in Washington now means quite a bit to me. Mainly, it is not a Jewish project. It's an official United States institution, I feel, just like the Smithsonian Institute or the Library of Congress. Because if a revisionist goes who say that the Holocaust is a lie, I can tell him that the government of the United States said it is true. And go to Washington, and see for yourself. Yad Vashem, it's also does a tremendous job, but they can say it's a Jewish institution. That boxcar who is in the Washington Museum, has...is significant because it was given by a Polish government. Just like the boat from Denmark was given by the Danish government. That's why this museum means quite a bit to me. That mean this is one more way that the world will learn the lesson of the Holocaust. It is a mission that's almost sacred. (Pause) OK?"
