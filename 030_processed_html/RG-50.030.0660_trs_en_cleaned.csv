Q: Smetona was the president of the country?,"A: Ina way, he wasn't super democrat, but he was very good to the Jews. And he needed the Jews badly.

And now we are the ""40s. And we, we, we, we didn't move. We should have moved. But where can we move? You cannot enter Palestine because the English don't let us."
"Q: I want to back up a little bit -- I want to talk -- I want to get a sense as a ten-year-old, eleven year-old child things start to change. I want to know how you experienced those changes. Did you have a Polish, Jewish, family stay with you, for example, in Kaunas?",A: Yes. One. It was a single man.

But it didn't come to an extent of hitting but maybe some other, boys and girls. But mainly not. It was not no. It was not -- I cannot tell and when the Russians came, everybody's equal. And the Jews have the same rights like everybody else but they had the same rights before too, they had even better rights. It was a shock but we stayed in the same flat.

There were 14 thousand Jews and ten thousand killed by Lithuanians in the first month. Killed. And the question is, why? And sometimes I think that the factor of to rob us and to look for gold and diamonds and things like this.
