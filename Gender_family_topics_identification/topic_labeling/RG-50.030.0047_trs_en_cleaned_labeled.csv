Q: Thank you.,"A: So in the beginning, when we were in ghetto, we have to go. We were organized. Young people -- everybody has to go in the morning under the guard to do work. So I was working with my older brother. We have to -- they took us to a special place. We were loading coals in the wagons forward and back, under heavy guard, from morning until late evening. And nothing to eat. Only you have to work in there. If you have something with you -- a piece of bread, anything -- you could have.And we work very hard. Then -- this was like in 1941. Then in 1942, they start to take so- called Aktion"" -- take people from the ghetto and make smaller ghetto. So they surround, for example, one part of ghetto. And this part people couldn't live there. They have to go to the wagon, to the train, and they was taking them out. Nobody knows where they were sent.There's only -- they're taking us another place. They will have good life working, and this and this. So the people cannot say no because there was an order. So you have to stay. So this was in 1942. 1941, they, they asked to get -- to give to them thousand young boys. But the ghetto, the -- no. In ghetto, the people who are partners like small government in ghetto, they, they was taking time. They didn't like to give the young people. They wanted to have a list of young people. So this was going to 1942. And then in the beginning of 1942, they said, ""Two thousand."" And they came. They have at least -- they came to our home, and they wanted to take me. But my younger brother, he was a little physical stronger, he said, ""No, I will go."" And they took him to the concentration labor-like camp in Lvov. And this was the young boy who they later hanged. And they took him there. He, he voluntary -- he was going because he wanted to save my life. And I was still working with my, with my parents and, Murderous campaigns undertaken by the Nazis for political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).and my brothers in ghetto. We apparently didn't know about deaths, what's happened to my brother. But my wife how she told you, she was going over there. She was in contact with us.She help us. She was working with my mother and father in this small shop. She was like our own sister, like a daughter. She was very attached to us. We were attached to her. But she was Aryan.She had no -- Catholic, so they didn't touch her. So she can go some. She was sneaking under the fences in the ghetto, and she brought something and this and this. We have contact.When they took my brother to Lvov, she was going to see him, because she was a girl and she was Catholic. She could go close and see something. He can go to the fence or something. She ask some watchman who are same day. Maybe they let her go to talk. So she was in contact with him. One thing she make arrangement with him, but she will break. He asked her that he wanted to run away and maybe she will hide him. So she has to bring him some clothes, this and this; and they make arrangement where, where he has to come to see her. And this time she came but they make special hours when she will meet him. But there was now going the military trains, and all kinds of civil trains were stopped. First, military.So it was a couple of hours, maybe two or three hours late she came, because the trains was - - she couldn't come. In meantime, he -- according to, to his agreement with her -- he left the, the camp, and he saw a woman who was similar to my wife. He came to her. And then she was not this right person. So when he was turning back, he want to go back, some watchman, they find him. They saw him. Now they took him back to, to camp. And when my wife came to see him, they told her it's too late. They hanged him. So she came very depressed.","[1, 2, 3]"

If you want, you can bring them little tea or something to drink. But go fast."" And I was running back to home, and I prepare something for them, and I came. It was too late. I saw them already pushing to the cattle wagon, with sticks. They was pushing.And my father, he turns -- like my mother was turned down; and he looked and he saw me, and he said like this [gesturing father waving goodbye to Josef]. And this was the last thing what I saw. Then -- and there was in the meantime other Aktion. And we still working hard.And, and November 18, 1942, there was the Aktion.Right before the people, they was finding out that they were an Aktion. So they make under the kitchen an apartment. There was like an entrance to cellar, and we make like a bunker.Was hiding entrance, and we make like a bunker. And we were sitting there. There was almost thirty people there, and we are sitting. And we went on November 17th at night there hiding. On November 18th, in the morning, start to be the Aktion. We heard noises, shooting, screaming. And barking dogs and everything. And we heard what's going on.Then, almost at the end, was almost probably before seven o'clock, after six, before seven o'clock in the evening, there was dark because the weather was snow, cold. And somebody pushed the window, and they said it was covered with sack -- with straw. We didn't know about that. Because was called a sound from the people who were Ordnungs,"" the people who was helping the, the, the SS men. He pushed with a stick the, the, the sack with straw, and was a little light. Because we were sitting in dark, but still came a little light inside. He said, ""If somebody's hiding there"" -- he said this automatically -- ""has to get out, because we will throw grenades insi-- inside."" So there was a woman near the window sitting. She pushed her daughter, and said, ""Go. Save your life."" She pushed her through the window.4 Ordnungsdienst [Order Service] (German).The daughter was maybe eight, nine years old. And she pushed her, and she start to scramble go through the window. And suddenly, the SS man who was far away, they was almost finished the job. They turned back and saw the girl coming out, and this guy, he was helping her. They came back. And they start to beat her and kick her with feet in, in the face in front of entrance. And then the mother start to scream. And they opened the doors, and they said, ""Out! Out! Out!"" And there was standing a row with soldiers and with policemen with rifles.And they throw us -- ""Ground! Ground!"" And was they hitting us with rifles. Who got down, they killed him on the spot. Who could run has to go another place. And they, they -- L, I, with my brother and my cousin, we were running. We got the full blows, but we survive. We came to the place they keep us together. And there came a sergeant, and he said, ""Now, we will shoot you. Stay in a row."" And my older brother, who was saying to me, he said, ""Aim your chest to the rifles. Because,"" he said, ""They will hit you in the arm or in your ear. They will not shoot you twice. And they will put line -- put you in a great big line, and you will suffocate. So try to aim yourself,"" he said, ""and stay."" And we were staying in line, and they with the rifles, they wanted to shoot us. Suddenly came an officer, an SS officer, and he's asking, ""What's going on here?"" They said, ""No. We find they're hiding Jewish people.According to the order, they're supposed to voluntary come here. They didn't come, so we picked them up. And now we have to shoot them."" He look on us. He said, ""No. The train still is under the station. We need fat Jewish people. We need there for some -- "" He said like soap or something, I don't remember so. ""Put them to the train."" And he put us -- they put us to the train. There was in my wagon was over a hundred people like sardine together, you know. And was -- this was winter. But we were thirsty, dry mouth, dry tongue. high temperature. We was sitting, and we couldn't, we couldn't breathe. And they locked the door.There was barbed wires on the small window. And the train start to move. And one man, he hang himself in the train in the belt, and they tried to cut him off, and they cut him off and he was angry.He said, ""No. I will not go for -- so you will have to... No! Don't! No!"" He was screaming.He hanged himself. And I was going, I said to my brother, ""No, I will not go there. I will commit suicide. I will not go."" He said, ""Don't do this. Don't."" I said, ""No, I will never go."" And I was going little by little, they helped me came to the window. And I don't know how I find in my pocket pliers. I have this small pliers. And I start to break the barbed wires. I was working a long time, and I cut my hands, was bleeding. And I broke the wires. When I was in bunker, I had a loaf of round bread. And I saved them. They was taking us, I took the bread. Here I had little belt. And when I broke the wire, I said, ""Push me through the window. I will jump."" And the people start to push me and my head forward. Was tight, but when I was looking down, I was on the running, you know, the wheels train. And then I saw the tracks and the small stones, like gravels. Everything. I said, ""No. I will not go with my head, because I will -- right to the wheels."" It was like instant. One second, I wanted tocommit suicide. Another second -- like instant -- I said, ""Put me back! Put me back!"" They, they pull me back, and I said, ""I will go with my legs forward."" And they pushed me with my legs, and I was hanging on the left hand. I was holding the window outside. I was hanging, and the train was in good speed. When the train was taking a curve, I jumped forward and I was sliding. And suddenly I felt severe pain in my chest, and I was unconscious maybe a few minutes. I don't know how long. Then when I came to my normal condition, I saw in my breast there was a hole like a fist. And this hurt my chest, because I stopped on a small post with wires. There were some wires. And I came out, and the train was far away, and I was running up the train. The train -- there was snow, and I was looking where would I find my brother. No, but I find two other boys who jumped. One has broken here bone, clavicula (ph) bone, broken. One was moving.Another, his face scratched, but nothing special. So I helped. I took the, the belt. I put like here [showing that he tied the arm to the man's side], to, to keep the hands not moving. And I said, ""We have to run away."" So we are going under the hill just like small way. There was snow. And we were going to the place that was called Lipowice. Was after Przemysl maybe seven kilometers, maybe more. And I went there, and I told them, ""I have here a man."" And normal, in wintertime of skiing, and I was coming to him to buy tea or coffee or some cookies. And I said, ""I will go to him. Maybe he will give us shelter for one night. But then he will think in the morning what he have to do."" And I went to him, and I knocked on the window. He opened, and I told him who I am. He was a nice man. He was scared, very, because he knows what happens. ""Nobody has seen you?"" I said, ""No, no."" And he gives us the shelter. We were sitting on the bench all night. And he give some to drink, you know, coffee or anything. People drink only water, because we have very high temperature, very.Then in the morning we said goodbye. And we said to each other, ""Everybody's going in different way. They will not catch us together. Only separate way."" As a matter of fact, after war I met them. They survive. So I went to my friend, who was working in hospital. And I went to him. I was holding my loaf, bread loaf, under my arm, and I was looking like a working man who's going to work. And when I came to him, he was scared. I told him what's happened, and he said, ""Ok, I will try to do the best for you."" And he was keeping me in a small cottage, which was his mother's cottage, but she was not in this time at home. So he said, ""Stay here."" He locked me inside. And I was there all day, and I didn't know what to do. And I was...""Maybe I can trust him, maybe no. Maybe he can go to Gestapo or something, and this will be the end."" But on the evening, he came. Was about eight o'clock.He said, ""Joe, I am sorry. I was going around. I cannot find place for you. I cannot keep you, because my wife she is scared. We cannot risk our lives. So what you want to do? Tell me. I will bring you in any place."" He worked in hospital, and he had those carriage with two horses. Always he could travel, because he can ride this. So there was -- on the other side of the Przemysl there was a bridge. So to go to the town where I was living before, we have to cross the bridge. But on the bridge, there was always watchmen, German.They were watching who was crossing; they were looking inside you're not smuggling something. So he said, ""I will risk my life and your life. But you have to lie down under my feet. I will cover you with a blanket. I will keep my feet on your face. And I have the pass, so I will try to go. But don't move. We will see. Maybe we'll be lucky."" And really, we went there. They stopped him. But they know him, and he's showed them the pass. They was looking inside, but they didn't look too much. He was holding the feet on my back. And we passed. So they came downtown, close to my street that I was living. He said, ""Joe, good luck. That's it. And do what you want."" I said thank you, and he left. So I didn't know where to go. I went back to the place where we were living before. And I went to cellar. There was not basement, only cellar -- open cellars. And I was sitting there, and, and I saw this is not realistic because the people who maybe who lives there know who was living there, they can come back to cellar. They will see me. There was open space. And there's -- in fact there were rats and mice and dirt. So I said, ""Maybe Stefania, maybe she will let me stay for one night."" And I went upstairs, and I was knocking at her door. And she -- first she asked me, I told her quietly, ""It's me."" And she opened the door, and she saw me. Now, I was really in very bad condition. And she was very mercy to me with her really soft heart. She was most caring. She helped me to wash and this -- and she gave me her bed to sleep. And her sister, she was wondering what's going on. Because she saw me first, little sister. And she explained her how this, anyway. And the morning, she put me under the bed; and on the front of me, she put a sack with potatoes. She had a sack of potatoes there. So I was behind the sack of the potatoes, and she covered me blanket. She said, ""Don't make noise, because the people are coming -- friends and this -- and they cannot see you."" So this was for a few days. Then she went to my brother. He worked in, in a farm which was under supervision of military, belonged to the military, and they -- all brothers was going through the military.So my brother was working there with his fiancee. And when was the Aktion in the ghetto, they hold the people there because they know they will go back to ghetto, and they will take them. The, the -- no, the SS will take them. But they wanted to save them, because they needed them for work. So they told them stay this night and one day more here. They were sleeping there. So my wife, she came. She told him what's happened, and she told him that I survive. I came, and I'm at her home. He was very happy. And he was crying, also, because we lost the rest of the family. And then his wife, and they was taking them back to ghetto under guard -- I don't know how -- she run away. And she came to us to home...to...to my wife's, where I was hiding temporary. No, she said, no, she will not go to ghetto. She doesn't like to go. I didn't like to either go to ghetto, but my brother, he went back to ghetto with the group. And then he came there. He start to contact with us. And then he told us in the ghetto now is quiet, temporarily is quiet. ""Nothing there, nothing. No Aktion. So you maybe you'll come back."" After a few days, we went back to ghetto.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What was the ghetto like at that time?,"A: This was no -- there were a few streets they surrounded with fences. And there was watch, like police. Police watch-- watching men, Polish, and there was German. Was the stationary because when it was Aktion, it came special group--SS or special military group who was taking the Aktion then or doing this. But when this other, they left to the domestic people to take care about the ghetto. That the people cannot get out, that cannot go in. But my wife's little sister. She was going, playing and she was the messenger. She was bringing some message. We wanted something. We asked her. She would prepare in, in the evening.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Ladder.,"A: Ladder. And...and no -- you can hear the noise if somebody stepping on the -- so I was hearing something. And I closed the door. And suddenly came one of the nurse. She was looking around, going around looking, not quiet. Was the last moment. And she went down, and she told them no. So my wife, she saw what's going on. Then she bought chicken, and she was holding the chicken in, in the hole, and the chicken was making noise. Something to, you know, to mask the noise. And this was what we're doing to, to try to, you know, to camouflage everything. Then about food. Her little sister, she was coming bringing something bread. I have always there a few loaves of bread, which changing I make some mess, like a nest; and there was exchanging every time fresh and they all using what we were eating. And to not make suspicious the, the neighbor, so she says, ""She is bringing bread and she is selling bread."" And always was going in this way, that they couldn't count how it is.What was hiding. And she never was talking to people. She could play with little children, and never -- she never said a word about us. And one time, they came. My wife, she didn't come to work. And there was another, she has to work. So she was -- a few days she didn't come because she was feeling sick. She didn't feel good. And I see through the window -- because always we were watching to see if someone could see a policeman is coming -- a Polish policeman and a German policeman is coming. So I told her, ""Go with us to the, to the"" I said, ""to the bunker. Hide. And they will only your little sister..She will tell them that you went to buy some food, you know, in the village, something."" And they knocked on the door, and she opened. They came. ""Where's your sister? Who are you, your sister? Where's your sister?"" Said, ""She went to the village to...to buy some food."" The policeman, he turned and slapped her in the face. She fell down. And he said, ""Why are you lying? Your neighbor, they told us that she was just now out here in the yard."" And she start stutter ""Why I, I have to lie? She went -- she has to go through the yard. So she was inthe yard, and she went to, to the village. How she can go to, to the village. She has to go through the yard, so maybe they saw her."" She talk to them. I, I don't know. She told she told them that she's going to, to buy food, and they look and they start to look around. She didn't have nothing there. A piece of bread and a little soup. Nothing. He said, ""That's all you have?"" ""Yes."" ""You're alone at home?"" She said, ""Yes."" ""You sleep alone?"" ""Yes."" ""You're not afraid?"" She said, ""Why I have to be afraid?"" ""That's what you are eating?"" And she said, ""Yes."" They left her, and she didn't say nothing. And they left her, and, and my wife was hiding, and she came out. That was one episode. There was many, many episodes during the time. There was almost two years. Every day, each hour was something that our life was threatened with gun. At the end, when our -- one thing was good. They have a radio, the German. And they was listening to the news, and I was listening to the news. And we can, they are listening to us we can thinking how they are going back. They're running away. And I said to my wife, ""Soon or later, very soon, you will have your Russian. Because they give them hell, and they ran."" And all my -- almost I find the day when they will come. And I remember the last day when we heard there was fighting. And we can hear the noise of the different noise of different bullet, different rifles.The Russians have different rifles, and the German have different rifles. We heard the difference in the noise. So I said to my wife, ""Probably they will come, but they are fighting."" We cannot go down, and we have to stay in the attic. But the bullets and ding, ding, ding, you know, was hitting. I said to my all people there, ""Listen, we have to lie down.Keep something between your teeth. If somebody -- they will hit somebody, you cannot scream. If somebody will be dead, he will be dead. This is our last chance. But if they find us, if somebody will scream, she will be killed and her sister will be killed. And we will be killed. Because everybody now look for each other. So you have to be prepared that something will happen no worse, nothing."" And we are lying down and listening, and she went down with her sister. She went down, and with the neighbors was waiting. And anyway, we under-- we can hear the bullet. Some start to be more close, and some start to go away. And I said, ""I think probably the Russian are coming. Because listen to the Russian sound of the bullets, the noise. But we will see."" Then early in the morning, by six or seven o'clock in the morning, I look through the small thing. They are going about six German soldiers with rifles, the helmets. All came back going on the street up. I said, ""My God, still, still there are Germans here."" And suddenly it came out a few boys with the armbands and a few soldiers, Russian soldiers and to them, ""Hands up!"" And they fell down, and they were begging. I said, ""Thanks God, we are free!"" And that's it. Next day, this what happened -- or the same day. I don't remember. Came two Russian, White Russian. One was the lieutenant and one was a sergeant. And they came. She was in the window singing, and this happened.And they came, and first they asked, ""Is Germans here?"" She said, ""No, there are no Germans here."" ""Can we come?"" And said, ""Ok."" They came inside. And my wife, sheclosed the windows; and they start to talk this and this and not so. My wife asked them always, ""How far are Germans? Maybe they can come back."" They was suspicious.""What?,"" they asking. ""What?"" ""Because,"" she said, ""there was one time that he went back, the Germans came back. So this is what I'm asking."" He said, ""Don't worry. They are chasing them. They are running away. They are loosing their pants, pants."" And they said, ""They are running away. They will never come back here."" And we heard. We were standing behind the doors, but we heard this. And we came and sat. But look, we couldn't talk, because we didn't talk, only were whispering for almost two years. We couldn't walk, because there was not walking up and down, just not exercise. We were pale, you know, and terrible. And they picked up their rifles. ""Who there?"" They thought maybe partisans. So she told them. And one of them was a Jewish lieutenant and his family was from Ukraine killed by Germans.And he -- and his sergeant, he was a regular Russian. He said, ""My, my goal is to chase the German and give them back what they did to my family, to my family."" He was crying. He was kissing us, hugging. He said to my wife, ""You are really hero! You are really hero!Without weapons, without nothing, you could fight so many as in the little girl, the sister."" They took pictures, and said, ""What you need? We will give you what you need."" He said, ""We have the German hospital here, there, there. The whole thing there. Loaded with everything. What you -- dresses, shoes maybe. And we will bring you meat."" And we said, ""No, no. Not now. We would like to have freedom."" And how we did it, because we were afraid about neighbors still. So we told them that -- it was night, we will go, the men, with them back to hospital. And next day, they will bring us, we will come back like guerrillas who are coming to, you know, with the army. And we will look for my wife. I will ask the neighbors about her. We will come like guests. We came. We survived; we will hug her, we will kiss her. So they will not suspect that it was us she was hiding people. They said, ""That's a good idea."" And we went, and the women and children were still with my wife there. Next day, in the morning, we came with them. There was a wagon with horses and everything was there. We had rifles with us. And I came, and I am looking; and I asked one neighbor. I know them, because when I saw them, I said, ""Hey, do you know if still around a...a girl?Her name is Podgorska, Stefania Podgorska. She's my friend, my, my neighbor. I have to seek her."" She said, ""Why, yeah, yeah, yeah. She is a good girl. She's...she's..."" They thought maybe we would kill her. Because some people came to take advantage, maybe somebody that paid them or hanged them. Said, ""No, no. She is my good friend. She's -- I'd like to see her."" She said, ""Well, she lives there."" We were going there. We knocked on the door. She came: ""Ahhh! Hi. Hi."" And we were greeting each other. And there was beautiful thing what she did. They -- we start to give to her some food, bring everything. And we lived --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Ok, we've got about two minutes. Is there anything -- this is quite a story. When you, you had embraced, you were free, where did you go?","A: In town, to find an apartment to live. And next day, I find apartment. Was occupied by German, some people. German, and they run away. They left everything they had.Everything was there. So I moved to the apartment. And I took the apartment. And then Ihad -- twice they came because there was some band of people who were killing people who saved Jewish life and, and the survivors. They killed them. They said, ""One bullet for the survivor, two bullets for this who saved them -- for them who saved them."" And they was going around, but after a while they caught them. They came twice to my apartment. I was living with my brother, his fiancee, my wife, her sister; and we lived there. And they came.That was on the second floor, and there was a balcony outside. There was knocking on the door. So it was night, was like in winter, in February. And they said -- I said, ""Who are there?"" And they said, ""Milice! Milice!(r) Open!"" I said, ""What are you looking for?"" ""You have to go with us to, to work. We have to fix the bridge. Is broken bridge."" I said, ""No, I'm not going at night with nobody. You have some business to me, well, come in the morning when it's lighter."" People. I will see who's who. They start to swear to me. ""Open the door, or we will break the door!"" Like this, like this. 1 saw who were there. I run on the balcony. I was screaming for help, help -- and they start to run away. This was number one. And then a few months later, another time they came. So the commandant of the city -- there was a Russian commandant. And I went to him, and he told me, ""Listen, you will never survive here.""","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You left, is that true?","A: Yes, I left. He said, ""Go to another part of Poland, where nobody will know you. Nobody.Change your name from the Pol -- Jewish name or German name to the Polish name."" And we did. ""Under new name, go and stay in another place of Poland where nobody knows you.Maybe you will survive."" But the best thing that I will tell, if I don't tell you this in secret. I ran away from him. This no place for me to live. We want to survive. ""Go west in the country. West, if you can."" And this happened. I went to Krakow. I changed my name. And then I went to Wroclaw. I was studying. I was accepted there. Again, I studied from beginning my dentistry. I graduated. I was working. I was assistant, and until I left Poland; and now I am here, thanks God. And I am very happy I am in the United States. I went here to Tufts University. I graduated, and I am a dentist. Thanks God.","[1, 2, 3]"

This was the old man who passed away after war, a few years after war. This is a woman and mother of two children. This is her son. And this is my brother's fiancee, and this time. No, excuse me. This is the wife of my friend, who -- she was survived, my wife, she saved her life and her husband. He passed away in, in Jerusalem, I think so. Israel. He was a dentist. Then, here we have what? That is my brother's wife. This was his fiance. And this is a father, he's a dentist still in Poland. He 8 Militia (French, but adopted into many languages).was with his daughter. We saved him and his daughter. And I was drawing at this time the faces.","[1, 2, 3]"
