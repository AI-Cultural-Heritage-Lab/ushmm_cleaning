And my mother le -- wasn't well at -- all of a sudden, because her first -- her first incident or ac -- or accident, happened when they bombarded Warsaw, and we were told by the - - that we should hide behind -- inside of the houses, or inside of the gates of the houses. And she did that, and this other -- arg -- other group, too, and she saw a little who was crying, and she gave her a candy. And somebody remark, you shouldn't do that, cause there's spies now, you're not supposed to do it. And before she knew, a policeman came in and I -- I nof -- not arrestedher, but took her to -- to a -- the o -- office -- police office and charged her with something, but they -- he let her go. She was very upset about it. And since then she wasn't very well.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was this the Jewish police who picked her up?,A: Pardon?,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Jewish police who picked her up, or the --",A: There wasn't any Jewish police at that time --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: At that time.,A: -- no. The f -- the Judenrat started to form po-police and so on --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- on -- on demand from Gestapo and Germans.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And did you think your mother was getting depressed, or she was getting physically ill?","A: Oh she -- no, she -- no, she wasn't well physically, and then depressed also, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So how old would she have been by -- around this time, do you think, about?",A: How bo -- how what?,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How old do you think your mother was?,"A: I don't know. Probably over 50, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Over 50.,"A: 50, yeah, or 56, I don't know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how was your grandmother at this time?,A: I don't know.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: But you're not working, cause there's -- there are no workshops set up, there's nothing --",A: No --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- set up.,A: -- there's nothing to do there. It was just because I knew the people there.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: Yeah. Well, actually, you know what Germans were doing, they were preparing us for all this what was coming, by depressing us, that we are much less regular people than -- then the -- the other folks.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did it work?,A: Yeah. I -- the -- that we are --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Not as good.,A: -- not as good as -- as German people.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how did that make you feel?,"A: Terrible, terrible. I -- at this time in 40's, and early ""41, I used to go outside to our friends who never moved from their places, counting probably on the -- the -- that -- that they didn't know [indecipherable] leaving, or they -- they knew, but they didn't disclose that. And they prevailed until the uprising.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,A: I'm talking about not the uprising in ghetto --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: -- I'm talking about the German uprising --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: The Polish uprising in deg44.,"A: -- right, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you were able to go in and out of the ghetto before [indecipherable],"A: Yes, yes, there were possibility and I -- I went several times. Just [indecipherable] took off the -- the band on -- on your right hand and -- and went and it was won -- wonderful. It's a feeling like something very heavy [indecipherable].","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was it dangerous for you to leave?,A: Not at thi --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You --,"A: -- this time, no.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: No.,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But you had a --,"A: Unless a -- I would -- I don't know, I probably didn't look very much Jewish, or something. I didn't have any problem. But it wa -- didn't last very long, cause they closed this -- this courts.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Courts? [indecipherable],A: Yeah. C-o-u-r-t.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: C-o-u-r-t.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,A: C-o-u-r-t.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So, as soon as you moved into this area that then became the -- the ghetto, the walled-in ghetto, were you put -- you had to put on an armband --","A: Right, mm-hm.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And it was -- what was the color, do you remember?","A: White with blue, the David --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So this must have been also extremely strange for you, and for everybody else.","A: I don't know. But you know, there was so many things around us which were terrible. First of all, the change of the living quarters. The -- the -- the surrounding, and you know, somebody's else house you live, and tha -- there was a lack of food. There was a -- our housekeeper, who used to come to our regular place where we used to live, and she brought some food from -- from reich. Reich was -- was anything which is -- which Germans occupied, it was called reich, r-e-i- c-h.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: And they were o-occupied [indecipherable] and -- and they -- it was m-more contact with other people, and here all of a sudden we're cut off of everything. And there was nothing to -- to live by.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So this was the least of it, having the armband, it was not -- was not as [indecipherable]",A: The armband -- the armband worked only in -- in the ghetto. When you go out -- you couldn't go out with your armband. Out of the ghetto you couldn't go.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did -- did things change really immediately when you moved, so that there was much less food, water, electricity --",A: No wa -- there was water.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: There was water?,"A: Yeah, yeah, for a long time, mm-hm. But food, yes, there were -- you know, the little boys were smuggling bread and all kinds of food. But when you paid the [indecipherable] which was the German, later on in the day, in -- lots of food came into ghetto by --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They smuggled it.,"A: You know, by -- yeah, mm-hm.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And then, what were they [indecipherable]","A: Everything has been smuggled, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And they would sell it sort of like a black market, they would sell it so they could get --","A: Yes, expensive, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: But you weren't working, your mother wasn't working, so how did you get food?","A: Well, we ha -- we had some money, and I -- wi -- we sold out a lot of th -- table sel -- silver and so on when we still were outside there, the ghetto, I went to -- to a market and sold out for whatever, flo-flour or what is -- oil or whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how did you bring in the stuff that you bought?,"A: Well, it wasn't ghetto at the time.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Uh-huh, so it was still [indecipherable]","A: No, it was before, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- that was alright. Before the wall was put up.,"A: Right, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And did you go see your friends when you went out?,"A: Yes, I went to my friends, I went to a friend very far away.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And did they suggest --,"A: Well, they -- they helped us a little bit, as much as they could, but not too much. We actually sold out everything before we went to ghetto, and we just lived day by day.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you think when you left the ghetto, in order to sell out stuff, that at some point maybe you should [indecipherable]",A: I didn't go out of the ghetto to sell.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I don't -- I know [indecipherable] yes, when you --","A: That was before that, yeah, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- when you moved into the area that became the ghetto.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you ever think of staying outside of that area, or --","A: Well, yes I did, but I didn't see any possibility. My sister could go to Brazil before we went to ghetto, when somebody gave her papers.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: And -- but she didn't. It -- it wasn't that -- it wasn't yet so strong feeling that we can't get -- that we can't get through, you know, in -- in a few months, in a year. We got this bullet -- bulletin, a Polish bulletin that it will not last long an-and so on, and you know, this kind of things. But the real break-out was the Stalingrad offensive and that was much, much later.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So tell -- let's go back. When -- when the -- when the wall is built, do you now have this feeling of what --",A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- this is not going to end so soon. Something --,"A: Right, of course. And we lived with this dentist friend and she had her windows turned into the place where they checking it out, the ghetto, and I looked what was go -- what's going on.You know they s -- they were beating the small children with [indecipherable] and cutting the Jewish Hassidim, the beards, and laughing [indecipherable] all -- was right there.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So it was just getting worse and worse?,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you now begin to see dead bodies, or was that later?",A: Dead body was -- was later.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: It was later.,"A: Yeah. Because they ev -- every -- every community, ev -- Jewish community which were left over, they were coming to Warsaw. It started to be, you know, not just wars -- Warsaw citizens, but everybody else. And from Germany and -- and even from abroad, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So there's a huge number of people who come into a very, very small --","A: Place, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: -- area. There's almost 400,000 people --",A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: [indecipherable] becomes the ghetto.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So this must have been awful.,A: Awful. In --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really chaotic --,"A: -- in living quarters, yes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,A: The typhus really began at that time.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: [had typhus, too.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You did?,"A: Yes. It was in 42, in -- in winter and all of a sudden I became very ill, and it -- there was a -- there wasn't an -- even doctors available, but a friend doctor came and gave me some whatever. I went through it with a very high fever, and if it -- it will become meningitis after the fever becomes really high. But I --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: But you got through it. So you were living with your mother, your grandmother, your sister, and your brother-in-law?","A: No, grandmother wa-wasn't alive.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Your grandmother was gone.,"A: Yeah. Grandmother was gone yeah, that was long time before.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Before you moved?,"A: Before we moved, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see.,"A: Oh, much before we moved.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: Yeah, yeah. She lived until, I don't know, ""36 or seven yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: deg36 -- deg36. And is your brother-in-law working, your sister working, or is no one working?","A: Well, he was working. We -- i -- you can't -- you can't say that --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- he was working. There was no workplace as [indecipherable] can imagine.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: There was, you know, some kind of a trading. You -- you had this and I give you that and then you give me I don't know what, flour or -- or macaroni or whatever and -- and so on. Or you have contact with the outside, meaning the Polish, which I had, and -- and could sell something to friends and they will give you any money. But that was all in the beginning, in the beginning of the ghetto.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. And do you remember these self-help organizations, house committees around Warsaw?","A: As far as I remember, it didn't -- it had nothing to do with me.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So did y -- you didn't know about s -- any soup kitchens, or --","A: Well, they were organized, all those kind of things, but I was out of the area.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You were out of that.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I see. And what about -- I do know that there were lots of -- there were lots of cultural activities, some [indecipherable]","A: Yes, there was, mm-hm. I was once only --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Once?,"A: -- ina -- in some kind of a -- a garden, you know, put up as a -- as a kind of a cafe or whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: Yeah. But it was only once. And th -- well, a lot of it is in -- pianist is a -- di-did you read that? Yeah, well, he has a -- a different approach to that, yeah, but I didn't know. Well, it was -- you know, it was for people who really made money, and some did. And some had contact withthe Gestapo. They thought this will help them to -- to get out of the deportation. But a-at the last time, it did not.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Mm. So as -- let's talk between 1940, in November, when -- when the ghetto -- when the ghetto really becomes enclosed, until before the deportations, what do you begin to think about the Judenrat at this time? Do you -- are you -- do you think they're doing a good job? Are you angry with them? Do you wonder what's --",A: About Judenrat?,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Well, it di -- you know, they -- they just couldn't do much. They were told one day they have to -- to send 10,000 Jewish men for work. And where would they find those 10,00 Jews?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: And it would -- was a -- a very bad job, I should say.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: Yeah, they -- they couldn't come out of it right. And once they were arrested, all of them, and there was a saying all over the ghetto that something bad is coming, and they were -- and they let them out in a couple of days. So we didn't know much about it, what was going on. We knew the [indecipherable] commando, which was in later years used to get people out of the houses, and march them to Umschlagplatz.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mmn-hm.,"A: That was a special unit, special German unit. And they -- they had also Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and -- and there -- that's what they help us, and dogs.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And dogs. And did you think that the Judenrat had kind of a special privileges, that they got more food, or they were more --","A: Maybe they had easier to get food, but I don't think they were ever paid or -- or anything. I -- Ihave no i --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: [indecipherable] didn't know --,"A: -- yeah, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: I -- I -- I knew only -- the demands were very well known, that they need more and more people t-to work.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: Yeah. And they -- the Judenrat couldn't handle it, it -- it was too -- too difficult to get 10,000 people to work one day, it was --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you hear things about an underground movement, or the political movements in the ghetto?","A: Very late, yes I had, because my -- my daught -- my sister husband, chi -- joined them for awhi -- as much as I know before I left ghetto.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was involved.,A: Was involved.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And do you know with what group he was involved?,"A: No, I don't, no. There were very -- as -- as far as I know, there were very few who really took part in the ghetto uprising and it was absolutely unbelievable what they have done. In the first day of the uprising, the Germans pulled out, it was such a strong --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- but of course later on it's -- it's [indecipherable] it was tragic.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. But did you -- be-before the deportations, did you know that there were political groups talking about what they should do, or what they were capable of doing?","A: Yeah, well, not much, not much. That it -- it was chaotic at first, you know?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: But later on when they decided to -- to -- to do that, th-there was smuggling of -- of weapons and I heard about it, I knew that exists.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. But that was not something that you were involved with?,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: When you were outside, di -- were th -- the puli -- the Catholics talking about underground or not?","A: Oh yes, yes, I heard through Stefan, uh-huh.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And when did -- did -- when did you see Stefan for the first time after the occupation? Do you remember?,A: I came out through the courts --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: -- and I walked the -- the main street of Warsaw, [indecipherable] Koska, and I s -- I seen him, but I didn't approach him. It was too dangerous at that time. But he saw me, and he approached me, and we went for coffee and he told me about his -- his marching 0 -- 0 -- the -- you know, because there were orders and six or seven September from radio, that all able men to carry weapons should go out toward the east.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: And he and his colleagues left. And that was a walking march, cause they didn't have any cars, nothing --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: -- right, yeah. It was something somebody [indecipherable]. And he went to Lvov, which is Lviv now. [indecipherable]. And they found out there is no -- no army, nothing. So they turned around and heard that Warsaw is completely demolished. And so they came back and he found out that he has to move out of th -- of his apartment where he lived, cause this part of Warsaw was given to Gestapo and other officers.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Uh-huh. So what was he -- when you met him, was he involved with --",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- the underground at this time?,"A: Yeah, at -- at first he was -- he opened a little store or whatever in books, but he didn't -- he didn't succeed. So he -- he got -- he got -- he had the friend in the taxation department and she gave him a ausweiss to go to ghetto. And [indecipherable] the people with taxes. Of course, he didn't -- there wasn't anyone to whom he can give the taxes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So he was supposed to -- there were tax collectors?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right? There were also people collecting money for gas, for electricity, as far as I understand it.","A: I think so, but I don't -- don't recall that.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So he was supposed to collect taxes for the Polish government?,"A: He was supposed to -- yeah, mm-hm, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And did he ever s --,A: Not Polish government --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: [indecipherable] whatever,"A: -- yeah, yeah, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was -- did he succeed?,"A: No, he didn't. He -- he just tried to get to the certain places, and there was nobody, or they changed their address, or they not living any more, yeah. So that was his job, and that's why he got the ausweiss, which let him go into the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Go in and out.,"A: -- yeah. So he visited his friends, his Jewish friends, and he dow -- he visited us too, and he brought sardines from Portugal, and soap.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And soap.,A: Which was a very important thing. Kind of a -- is kind of a large --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Large soap?,A: Is kind -- yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So how often did he come into the ghetto, do you remember?","A: Well, oh once a week or --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: -- something, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you would see him once a week?,"A: Right. And he -- he told me finally in October -- think it was October, ""42 or some -- that his ausweiss is running out and if I want to come out to his apartment, I am welcome.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And what did you think?,"A: I didn't think anything about it. Well, you know, it -- it -- well, going back it's so difficult. It's so difficult to -- to know what I'd been thinking each time, after each catastrophe. It -- it's very hard to thi -- maybe I didn't think at all.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Maybe you just passed it by.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: [indecipherable] he said it -- uh-huh. Were you becoming close friends at this point, were you be -- o-or not?","A: W-We were -- we were friends, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You were friends.,A: Or re -- I know -- I knew some people who lived with him --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: -- and that was the connection, it was -- he -- he had a -- a [indecipherable] who was Finkelstein actually. And they had the an-antique store in Warsaw -- I mean, before the war, and she lived there and another couple, a Polish couple live. The apartment was large --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- as -- for the -- for the Steins.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: For the Steins, right.","A: Yeah, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I think what we'll do is we'll --,A: Okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- stop the tape at this moment --,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- and continue in a few minutes.,A: Yeah. This was one -- End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay. Let's talk about when you actually have a job in the Tebbins shop. It -- when did -- how did --,"A: Yeah, was a -- was a job.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: It was a job for ausweiss, you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: When you got the special pass.,"A: Right. And I don't remember, I just went there and was told that I -- I can work there. And they were sewing the camouflage outside, the camouflage an-and the white part was underneath so they could, you know, in snow -- in snow, it doesn't show. And I didn't know how to sew on that, you know, sewing machine. So I was -- hadn't finished some of the thing. And th-the hours were terrible, because it was -- I don't remember, from eight to -- to one or two o-or from four to -- to 12 o'clock at night. And we were fall asleep, of course, all of us. And we got food there, and they brought it in large kettle with soup, which wasn't soup [indecipherable]. There was some -- some food at the very end, so it was lucky, you know, to get the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You mean at the bottom of the pot.,A: At the bottom of the p -- yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. So did you try to wait the [indecipherable],"A: Well, some did, of course, yes. But -- and there was bread, I think to the na -- probably now it's a very -- very much looked after, this kind of bread which was dark -- black and you had all - - all seven grains, or eight grains, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: And -- and th -- I worked there, but th-the first time which I got into this big walk, you know, through the Warsaw to deportation that -- I wasn't at Tebbins, I was at home, whatever I want -- went to look for some -- something, I don't remember what. And I was swept out with this large crowd which was filling in both sidewalks and the middle of the road, they were just going people with children, with -- with bundles of -- of -- of food -- not food, I don't know what, and that -- and we were going toward Meeska, toward the Umschlagplatz and the gates were closed when the took out the people from the -- from the houses, they closed the gates. You know, that's kind of gates what you come at 11 o'clock that used to be, and you had to wake up the -- the guy who takes care of the -- an-and give him 20 cents or whatever because you came late. So they were -- they were closed tight --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You mean, outside -- the outside gates --","A: -- outside, right, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: -- of the house, yeah.","A: Because the houses were -- they had that -- the gate was open over there, and you come in and walk to the right or to the left or further down where it's called Pardvuka, which was a larger part [indecipherable] something like that, where the housekeepers were -- were cleaning the rugs from upstairs. A-And -- but one of -- if wi -- I recognized one of the policemen that I knew him, and he recognized me, and he showed me on the way to Umschlagplatz that one of the gates is a little bit open, not completely shut, and I followed that. Came out of the crowd and I thought well, I've nothing to lose, and sneak in the -- the -- the gate. And there was a lot of people there, and we waited for a couple of hours until everything calmed down, and the people who were hiding in -- in the apartments, they came out and they told us how to go to -- to different streets.But the streets, you know, they -- the houses were cut like alleys so you can go through one street to another without coming out on the main street.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see.,A: And so I went home and they couldn't believe that I -- I am still there.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So they were frightened because they saw all these people and they knew you were in the street.,"A: Oh they -- they knew nobody -- nobody came out of it, and so they were very happy about it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What did -- what did you know about these deportations at this time?,"A: Oh, we know a lot, but we thought, you know, Judenrat helping to that. That this is all some lies. Those are young boys who just fled, you know, the [indecipherable] and -- and th-that's not true, it's -- but we started to believe that is something wrong at the end of the line. But a lot of people did believe.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So in -- in ""42, when the deportations begin, you've heard stuff about Treblinka?",A: Even before that.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: E-Even before.,A: Not trebli -- not a name --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,A: -- th-th-there were other names. There was Sobibor and there were -- th-there were -- that wasn't the only trebli --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: Treblinka was the one which took so many lives. That was the -- the end. There was no -- nobody, you know, nobody a-as far as I know nobody escaped from Treblinka.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: [indecipherable],"A: I don't know, do you?","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Well, there was an escape later. There [indecipherable]","A: Yeah, maybe yeah. Because some were left to | -- sort out the -- whatever th-the others left.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right.",A: Yeah. But --,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So what did you be -- do you remember what you believed? After -- at the attack on Russia, there's a lot of killing that goes on.",A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right? That the Germans are killing. Do you hear about those killings as the Germans are attacking Russia in 41?,"A: Oh yeah, we knew about it, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You do? And what did --,A: Cause we -- we had this bulletin from [indecipherable],"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: Who -- who brought in the -- the bulletins.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: And we knew what was go-going on in the world, and it's -- it was getting, you know, better, and -- but who knew when it will end? We -- we t -- we thought at first, you know, when we lived outside the ghetto, that this will last half a year, a year --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- but not five.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: Well, w-we -- we just didn't -- I -- we didn't have time to think about it, you know? I-It -- it was struggling every day. Every day you need food, you need -- your mother is not well. It -- it wasn't the -- the only -- when we got this news, it was far away, and nobody cares. Nobody cared. There was a time which I later found out, that Americans and English knew everything what is going on. So -- not only through Karski, there were many other people who -- who came and -- and w-were telling what was going on, not only with Jews, but with Poles. And nobody could believe that they're taking those people and just putting them under gas. At -- at first they were just r -- large vans, which we've heard about it. No -- nobody believed it. It was -- it was impossible to believe. So everybody thought, you know, where are we going? But later on, it started to dawn on us that this is the end, and everybody who could -- there was building of hide- a-way kind of things. You have a stove and you -- behind the stove there is a room there, and the -- So i-- you put the stove at -- at the -- at the entrance, and there was nobody there. So these people survived. How they survived, it was terrible, because I was in one of those ones, and I was told that there were small children with us, and the parents knew if we hear somebody coming [indecipherable] or SS, or what -- whatever, that we ca -- we just have to smother the child. Yes. And since then, when I went to one of those because I was not at home, I was going out, and there was an alarm that Ukrainians are coming, and I didn't go an -- any more to these hiding places, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: To this -- uh-huh.,"A: But there was a lot of these hiding places, and I think until they -- they -- the up -- uprising in ghetto, that a lot of people were safe this way. Oh, I -- of course, I -- I don't know. A lot of people outside the ghettos w-were saved to the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: -- until the Polish uprising.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Let me go back a little bit, to the work. How -- do you remember about how many people were working in that shop?","A: Well, I don't remember exactly, but in my room there were probably 40.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: 14?,A: 40.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: 40.,A: 40.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: But th-there were other rooms, you know, where they were working. Actually, they -- I must say on behalf of Tebbins that he was giving those ausweiss rather knowingly, that those people don't know how to sew.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh. Including you.,"A: Including me, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So nobody trained you on the machines?,"A: No, I -- no, I started to -- to use the machine when I was out of there, yeah. So that was --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was there -- were there Germans -- German officials in the shop?,"A: No, no --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: No.,"A: -- nobody, nobody. When the -- that -- that was kind of a relief, that was nobody there except the supervisors. One was called Jan -- Jahn -- Jan -- H -- J-a-h-n. And when I was liberated already outside in Quakenbrick where we li -- used to live for awhile at the -- with the Polishpress, I saw a man on the street and I thought it was Jahn, and I told Stefan, he said, oh, you have ideas. I saw him another time, and I was so sure that it was Jahn, but Stefan said no, that's probably not. I gave up. You give up on -- on the lot of things. When we were at the -- under the bureau [indecipherable] under the British and we occupied as part of Germany, we got the print shop for our -- our newspaper. And the -- the owner of the print shop was coming to those journalists, and telling them, I never was a Nazi, I never -- never had anything to do with them, and [indecipherable] a-anything, he would say. And they were listening just, you know. Nothing -- nothing happened to any of those people, and he was a Nazi, there is no -- but there were a lot of them who had to join the -- the -- the party, because of their living. He had very nice print shop and -- and he wanted to keep it, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Wer -- were you able -- did you get something other than soup so that you -- some food that you were able to bring back to your mother and your sister and brother-in-law, or not?","A: N-No, no.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You couldn't. And of course there was no pay, there was no -- it -- the only thing you got was food.","A: No, that that I seen. I didn't.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How long did you work there?,"A: That's -- you know, it's difficult for me to say, I -- I -- 1 do-don't know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Months? Years?,"A: I -- until -- right -- well, maybe a few months. Until the moment when the -- the second Umschlagplatz happened to me, and then I stopped working, and the only food it was -- which was smuggled and w-we bought, and it was pretty bad.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So the first time you escaped deportation, you were just -- you-you're just sort of swept along on the street. You never get to the Umschlagplatz.","A: No, I didn't.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. So that was probably July, do you think, ""42?",A: That was July deg42.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: The first -- the first wave of --,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- the deportations.,"A: 20 - something, 25"".","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right.","A: It was a -- a crowd which is difficult to explain. We were walking one by one, and the children didn't cry. It was quiet.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: Yes. Nobody tried to escape. We were paralyzed. I-It was a unbelievable scene, just those dogs marching, an-and there weren't too many Gestapo people, they called -- those are special forces -- were special forces I heard, at home. And at -- that what you struck by the absolutely paralyzed people walking. It's -- it's unbelievable, I -- it -- it -- the -- the way I -- I -- I looked at this Jewish policeman, I thought I know him, and he kind of made it -- eye contact to me, and I thought he showed me with his eyes the -- the next gate, which was how -- and that was it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So how do you explain the fact that you were not paralyzed?,"A: Well, I don't know. Some people were not, you know. Some people made their way probably in other gates. I -- I have no idea.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I guess it's surprising that you would say it was so quiet. I would have expected --,A: It was quiet.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: Yeah. Maybe a -- a whimper of a -- the child or something li --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But not much.,"A: -- but no, no, no. The same was the second time when I was at Umschlagplatz.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So now --,A: Nobody said anything.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really. So how -- how did it happen that you were at the Umschlagplatz the second time?,"A: No, no, it was -- no, it was later, it was September probably --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: September?,"A: -- yeah. And I was walking, y-you know, to get some money or food, I don't know what. I went to Paviar Street, and all of a sudden I see a rush of people, but not as big, not as large as the previous one, the July one. And I was caught in it, and I walked with them. A young woman walked with me and we exchanged some words, but not much. And we went to a barrack which was -- I don't know what it was before, you know, because it's -- was kind of remod with table and -- and chairs. And the chairs were made of steel, you know, the kind of -- something like what we use now when a lot of people come. And we found a place and we sit down and waited for the train.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you're at the Umschlagplatz you think?,A: Pardon?,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You're at the Umschlagplatz?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you're waiting.,"A: And outside there was no -- no Germans inside, or maybe they were at the doors, but outside the -- were Ukrainians with dogs. And that was it, it was kind of quiet, nobody talked unless whispered to somebody. And I noticed that some people are going around and behind me, going to something which is open, and stairs are leading. And I talked to my companion, I said, I think there is something there. And she said, yes I know. How do you know? Somebody probably escape, but she said Ukrainians come later and shoot the people who are hiding. So there is no way. I said, well let's try. And she tells -- she said no, I don't want to because I still hope that ll find my family. I didn't say it -- anything. And she took money out of her -- you know, the -- the -- there used to be [indecipherable] which is -- they were different kind of -- there were no tights, but they were draw -- you know, yo-you draw from your corset and tie your --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: [indecipherable],A: -- your -- yeah --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Your -- your stockings.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: And she -- she -- I said, I am going. And she took out money out of, you know, her stocking, and gave it to me. I turned around and you know that -- these iron chairs were noisy, so I tried not to make noise. I got up and sl-slinked down, and went dis -- up the stairs.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So did you go on the floor? So you didn't stand up?,"A: 1-- Lalmost didn't stand up. I was just crouching, li-like this, and I walk.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: When I went the stairs, they were dark and when I came up, it -- it was a -- a door to some kind of a attic or -- or I don't know what it was, and wa -- there were some furniture, sa -- some things were lying down, but it was completely dark. And I went there and I -- I just sit down on the floor. And it was quiet, very quiet. I think I -- my heart was, of course, pounding. It stopped pounding after maybe I don't know, half an hour or so. And I probably fell asleep, because what I heard the next, it was [indecipherable] of these chairs and steps and later on schnell, schnell, the Ukrainians with the dogs, and it -- it took quite awhile. And I felt that people are around me, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But you didn't see anybody?,"A: No, I didn't see, because it was dark.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: I don't know, they -- it was a stockroom, so some kind of a -- a -- and then I heard the train and the doors closing down. And we waited. I think we all fell asleep probably. Kind of a early morning, we heard voices. One vo-voice, or two maybe, and they said, just stay where you are, don't move. And we -- we thought what is -- but in Polish, not [indecipherable] and we thought, wa -- what is it? And came there, either they were dressed like medical people or they -- they put it on, I -- I have no idea. And they let us out and took us to the hospital. Gave us some tea and something, and show us the way to ghetto.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So the room that you were in w -- led into the hospital that was right next door?,"A: Oh, no, it wasn't very next door, but there wa -- probably was close. They had the -- some kind of part in. Maybe they made the -- some kind of opening in the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: In the wall?,"A: In the -- no, it wasn't the wall. I-It was -- th-the long fence, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Really?,A: -- [had -- I -- I can't tell you because I have no idea.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Were you a -- were you a good cook?,"A: Yeah. I don't know, no.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: No.,"A: Not yet, not yet, because Stefan always reminds me when he came and potatoes were boiling and I was asking my mother, mom, ho-how much salt, do I put salt? So it was a --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So your living conditions were actually much better together?,"A: Oh yes, yes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Of course, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did -- did you find it, I don't know, disturbing or odd that the difference between the ghetto situation and the rest of occupied Warsaw was so different?","A: Yeah, well, it was different, yes, it was different, but th -- they suffered a lot, too, and all of a sudden, you know, comes a German outfit and rounds up several blocks and takes out people from trams and take them to -- to Germany to work, or just shoot them for no reason.

Q: Yeah.,"A: Well, there were others who will come and ask for money and -- and other addresses where a -- where Jews live [indecipherable] you know, it's -- it's a -- it's always a -- and it was also on the Poles side, if you find a Gestapo or SS or whatever, they find the house where Jews are hidden, they would shoot everybody or take everybody to a concentration camp.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: So it was -- it was quite a decision to take Jews in, especially men.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Why especially men?,"A: Well, they were circumcised.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, oh, taking in Jewish men, uh-huh, I see what you mean, yes, right. So they could be easily found out. So do you think more women were -- were saved in these circumstances than men --",A: I don't know.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- because it was less dangerous?,A: Probably.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: Probably. Well, men usually, at the ghetto situation in the beginning and later, they choose to go east.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mmn-hm.,A: And that was a good idea. That -- thi -- it doesn't mean that they didn't wind up in a gulag.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Yes, cause it was [indecipherable]","A: Well, we had to wait for the Red Cross to -- to make sure that we are -- be treated as -- not as bandits, but as fighters.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: As POW -- you mean as soldiers.,"A: Right, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So the Red Cross came in?,"A: Oh, Red Cross came in, yeah, uh-huh.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And so Stefan is taken as a prisoner of war?,"A: Right, and me too.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you too?,"A: Right. I was working at the hospital at that time. I started to work when the uprising started, and I stayed there, and we were taken.","[1, 2, 3]"

So Peter and I, we took it out and I started walking -- Connecticut was at that time famous for the small art stores and I went from one to another and they said no, no.

"Q: Right. Were they -- did they treat you with s -- a certain kind of respect because you were fighters, or were they brutal to you, the Germans?","A: No, they were -- they w -- those were all the Germans who -- would took care of the train.And the same was the -- at the camp too.

Q: It was a long walk.,"A: I-It was a long one. We -- we just took, you know, break for the night and it -- everything was empty and things were trashed out because I think the Russians already took care of the -- of the better things and left it there, yeah. There were chicken wandering around, but no sign of -- of Germans, who used to live there. So we came to Elba river, and there on one side were the Russians, on the other side were -- were Americans.

Q: Did you like being in England?,"A: Yes, but it was a hard life after war. Everything was ra-rationed. I remember eggs were coming from -- from Poland and they were not e-eatable.
