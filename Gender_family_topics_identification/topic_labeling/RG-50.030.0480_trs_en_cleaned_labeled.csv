And German know this after the war, and before too, the big concentration Jewish people in Poland, that's,from my point of view, was created and yet -- and German created so many concentration camps in Poland. One of the important concentration camp was Auschwitz. The Auschwitz was built first couple weeks after a war was [indecipherable] 1939, and first prisoner was not Jewish people, was Catholic people. And which one Catholic people? All professors from university. All the lawyers, engineers, and clergy was sent first to concentration camp, Auschwitz.

Many German people was there, that's was political prison. And that's my own concentration camp.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Yes, okay.","A: -- now you remind me. Mostly was a economical problem. And that's -- if we call this anti- Semitism, that's wrong. That's was economical. Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close together and was the same token, more successful. And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the east, was more lazy, like all the Russian this time. Not produce so much, not educated so much.And start the different between Jewish more educated and -- and born on the east part of the Poland, more lazy and more -- not created. So -- and that's was all time the different economical.Not only anti-Semitic -- I understand, because you are Jewish, you are no good. You are a Polish -- Polish, you are good -- you are good. And question is, economical -- the answer is economical base. That's if somebody called the anti-Semitism, that's not right. I not feel this way. Was some people was, from the point of view. This is -- Jewish mean this fellow is different like we are, because the fellow has [indecipherable] the fellow has the factory, the fellow working hard. And ss -- that's not ss -- for me it's not ss -- right. What I understand before the war, that's was only different on eco -- economical base, not religion.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you don't think that there was some kind of difference based on the fact that Jews believed differently than Catholics or Protestants?,"A: No, I don't think so, I don't think so. I -- Ia -- race, you know, but to different people -- in my class, for example, was many -- not many, couple, Protestants. Nobody never talk about [indecipherable] feel this way, I feel other way. Generally speaking, like I said before, this was economical base in Poland.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay, so let me ask you something. When Hitler comes to power in 1933 --",A: Yes?,"[1, 2, 3]"

Some part of student in university created some, we are against the Jews who are educated in our university, because Jewish are 10 percent of the population, and in our class are 40 percent the Jewish people, educated by state. That's economical [indecipherable]. And all some student who said Jewish in our class supposed to be 10 percent, not 40 percent. And now you can call how you like, Anti-Semitist, or economical [indecipherable]. You see, that's the very big question.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Do you think that the numerous clauses that was put into effect, the numerous clauses, which didn't allow as many Jewish students as before was a function of economics?",A: Economical --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: -- because some poor guys -- as -- very smart, cannot go to university because there was already, for example, 40 percent Jewish people. And this guy was [indecipherable] not me? Why I cannot go there? You see, that's the story. You must look both ways. And still I have very big respect for -- this time, for Jewish parents, try and pay for education own children. That's I mention [indecipherable] we must look after Jewish people. And take the sample, educate it own people. And this time, in Poland, many people not think this way. And Jewish people was ahead, educated own children. That's the very important.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Min-hm. Right.,"A: Some crazy guy at left or right, that's was not my idea. I try balance in my life opinion. And still Hitler did the worst part what happened to Jewish people, Polish people and other people who was lost life in concentration camp and death camp. That's what happened right now, and I not see in the newspaper in America right now mention how many people die, how they this or this.

Q: You knew.,A: -- why. We know this is for insulation the Jewish people from [indecipherable],"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right.","A: And we know, and we know the next be Polish people. Maybe not this way, other way, and be very danger from German part of [indecipherable]","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: In the underground, was there a discussion about what this would mean for the Jews --","A: Oh sure, and --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: -- an-and what, if anything, should be done?","A: Anything, that's -- that's very, very difficult question.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yes, I --",A: Talk about what can be done.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: And what -- if you suggest we do something like this, and you don't know, you must think how many people lose the life doing this. Sometime was not possible.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: And doing something for Jewish people in this time was -- many think not possible because was army -- army people working for this idea, Hitler idea, put the Jews there. For example, some -- we -- and we have not power for this, our organization I know -- not my unit, si -- in our organization help Jewish people who stop uprising. And was too late. And beside this, some people here to gi -- why you no-not give the arms to Jewish people in ghetto. Warsaw uprising was lose because was not enough guns, not enough ammunition, not enough nothing. In other words, give Akar, Armia Krajowa prepare a-and train Jewish people during the ar -- wa -- jury -- Jewish uprising and help was not possible. Was really not -- I help, I bring the sandwiches there each day or so -- or something, and that's nothing. There was half million people.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: And you know, Polish underground men go to -- through the all borders from Germany to Hispania and later there to Anglia, and Mr. Karski, you know --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: -- that the name, go there and talk to [indecipherable] talk later there to -- to the President Roosevelt. And the people not believe first, and second, between us, Jewish people not help much. New York Jewish people not help much Jewish people in Warsaw, because was not -- not believe can happen to people like this.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you know of Jan Karski's work during the war, or did you only find out about it after?","A: No during the war, I know after the war.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That he was a --,A: And I know him personally.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: I know him personally. A very nice, you know, brave man and etcetera. And during this war, underground army cannot do mu -- much more.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mmn-hm.,"A: Because was each -- we must be careful with the underground, also many German people live in Poland [speaks Polish here] was spy for Germany. And you must be very close -- if we talk together we go outside, not inside because maybe is something not --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: -- connect some instrument and that was not so easy. Now, every pa -- body criticize. For example, Jewish people suggest the railroad tracks in Poland to Auschwitz supposed to be -- supposed to be bombard by alliance. Never happened.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You mean by Americans?,"A: By -- right. By American or a -- or a -- English. Never happened. You see, because this was calculated risk, is not make sense, we must win the war. Meantime, you win the war, and how many Jewish or Polish live -- lost your life?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: You know that's politics -- and -- and besides this, you must know one thing. After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take first all guns, all radio, all instrument against the enemy, and in Poland was not -- you cannot buy gun, you cannot have some ammunition, because everything German took out. And later there, before start the Warsaw uprising, how you can have the guns? Buy from the German who are against the war happen, or kill the German and take the ha -- gun. Was not so easy.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: Because if you kill one German, a hundred people was hanged tomorrow or -- or shot tomorrow. That's very -- very touchy moment.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right.","A: That's not so easy, because somebody special, who never know in conspiracy, and never know the organization Armia Krajowa think we supposed to do more, or why you not do this, how you not -- that's was everything calculated, you know. If you do something good for one person and lost two person home, that's not make sense. And etcetera. And I am a little bit upset maybe, cause Karski was in the west, and not help -- help, and not support ne -- from American government and from Jewish government -- for Jewish, I am not [indecipherable], in Jewish.And that's was for me big question, why. I understand for example, the New York Jewish organization cannot give the guns, cannot give ammunition, and can't give the money -- money, and for money, American money, you can buy in Poland this time, everything. And that's my point, the personal point view.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right,"A: I not represent, you know, some organization.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, I understand.",A: And that's my personal view.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: And I know these people can help little bit more own people. That's my feeling.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Right. Paul, I think you shouldn't hold the -- dro -- I think you should drop the wire. Okay, good. So, there is something called a transfer office.

The people laying on the floor -- street, dying. S-Some people without the clothes --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: -- because if somebody die on the street, the other people take the clothes and sell or something like this. It was very, very upset situation. I told you before, the living situation in ghetto was worse like in co -- in concentration camp.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So did you think that the Nazis -- the Germans were in some ways killing the Jews?

And mostly the German ask Judenrat and press -- give couple thousand people daily, daily, for work in east. That's was idea. After couple months -- couple weeks, the Polish underground organization check where the people are going on the east, and start know that's was Treblinka, a-and Sobibor -- Sobibor, and the other camp where the people was killed by gas, and later there cra -- cremated. And -- and the last time I remember the Jewish rat was obligated -- mean Jewish rat and -- Jewish policesupposed to deliver 10,000 people daily. And this go to Umschlagplatz.

And you know, the people who die on the street, Judenrat organ -- organize the -- some transport.Two wheels and platform and two guys, or three guys take the s-street the dad -- dead body and put later there to the Umschlagplatz. Because to Umschlagplatz people know more like I know, I understand if was coo -- supposed to be deliver 10,000 people for example, the police take the dead people too, means hundred dead, plus 9,900 people. In other words, the transport com- commander inside the ghetto take the dead body and deliver someplace. I don't know, I know it's not there. And you cannot see hundred people -- thousand people right -- right ya -- one day on the street, because each day, or all time continue, was clean the street, by the dead body. Still, I saw not one, not two, hundred people dying or dead on the street. Was terrible situation, terrible. That's was hunger, people have nothing to eat.

And work was the Jewish people on the other side, some way, or you saw some hole in the wall, maybe foot by 18 inches. The children go through. Children go through -- go to Aryan place, and beg or make business, these small guys. Bring the money and buy some -- something, I don't know what kind food. Buy something and later right through the hole, deliver there. And many people -- many time happened the gendarmes was over there and ki -- killed the guy, young child. And we was popular in Poland -- Warsaw, in Aryan area where the young children doing something, buying or -- or begging for food. Mean, even, ghetto was terrible, terrible situation.
