And my first memoryInterview with Maurice Friedberg me August 12, 2009 of the war was a Nazi airplane flying very low, and somebody living in the same apartment building jumping out of the house with a small revolver, the kind of -- the kind that ladies would have in their bags, and he shot at that plane.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: So where yo -- you went with your mother and your brother, an-and -- and was -- did you go with your grandparents to Tarnopol?","A: No, no, because they were in Rzeszew, and we were in Jaroslaw.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: So one morning a couple of Nazi soldiers and local collaborators appeared in -- in our apartment and they gave us five minutes to get ready, and they deported us onInterview with Maurice Friedberg "" August 12, 2009 the other si -- to the other side of the San river, which was to become the Soviet zone of occupation, as distinct from the German zone of occupation, which they decided to make free of Jews.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So you were deported, this wasn't -- this wasn't a decision that was made by your mother to -- to leave.","A: That's correct, that's correct. And I remember we arrived at the bridge on the river, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor. There was a -- a roadside -- a roadside sign which says in German, nach Palistina, to Palestine. And we were just -- we were just pushed to the other side of the river, and then the Germans returned to their side of the river, and we were on the other side for a few days, and it was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up. I remember we stopped in this small Jewish town, and my mother wanted a place where she could wash me and my kid brother. And it turned out that the only place where you could get washed was the local mikveh, the religious bathhouse where -- where women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves again clean. And in that little town, it was a town with a single industry. The industry was making twittel(ph) -- making the phylacteries that observant Jews used for prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead. And then a few days later we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army disintegrated, and the -- there was absolutely nothing else for him to do. And thereInterview with Maurice Friedberg deg August 12, 2009 were people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends. And that's how -- and that's how he found us.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did he know that you had gone to Tarnopol?,"A: No. But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that side of Poland. And so he went to Tarnopol, and so did we, and that's where we met.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So, you were not deported to Tarnopol, you were deported over the San river.",A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And -- and then you had to figure out what to do.,A: That's right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.","A: That's right, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to Tarnopol, were they terrible? I mean were there -- were there a lot of people?","A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no shortages, and whoever lived in that area would try to share with us some food or whatever else was available.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So, when you were sent over to the San river, that -- that -- you were walking, I gather.","A: That's correct. Interview with Maurice Friedberg 8 August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you have a little backpack -- not a backpack, but a knapsack with you or something?","A: Yes, yes. So would have -- so you would have some laundry to change into.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,A: And I think an extra pair of shoes or something like this.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, but you couldn't carry anything very heavy, clearly, right?","A: No, no, of course not.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did your -- did your mother carry some food with her?,"A: A little, but not much. Again -- again, it was some bread and cheese.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. And, did you walk to Tarnopol then?",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And were there -- you had relatives there, I gather.",A: My mother's sister lived in Tarnopol.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,A: So that's where we went.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you went there and you stayed there in -- in their home?,A: We stayed in their home for several months until the deportation to Russia.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So it was just a few months?,A: Just a few months.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So you get there in September, and you leave --","A: And we left next spring, when the -- the Russian authorities asked all the refugees who came from the other side, who expressed their preference, the preferences being to remain a Soviet citizen and stay at Tarnopol, or to go back to the places from which they were ejected by the Nazis, which is what we chose to do, because that's where most of the family was, in Rzeszew, and some even in Jaroslaw, because not all of us were deported of the same day.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. So you wanted to go back.,A: We wanted to go back because we wanted to be together with the others.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. But this was a ruse by the Russians --,"A: That's correct. And one night they appeared in my aunt's apartment, and they read our names and they said, you will have your wish carried out, and they took us to the railroad station, put us in cattle cars, and we were supposed to go to the other side of San river, but instead when the train began to move, it became obvious that we were moving in the direction of east, rather than west, and east was Russia.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. We -- let me go back a little bit. What -- what was it like for you on Tarnopol? Was this a difficult time for you, or was it okay?","A: It was okay. It was not very difficult because there was no -- there was no strict rules about behavior or buying or selling food. So, you know, th-there were a few tules, which were not terribly strictly observed, until they put us in those cattle carsInterview with Maurice Friedberg (r) August 12, 2009 and begun to move in the direction opposite to the one that we expected to be moved to.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right. So it wasn't -- so -- so you -- did your father work during that period of time in Tarnopol?",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: He did. Where did he work?,"A: He -- he worked on behalf of the authorities examining state property to make sure that nothing would collapse, or burn down, or get stolen. But again, this was a very pro forma kind of arrangement, which was supposed to change into more perm- permanent one, until -- until we were sent to those cattle cars, and until the train began to move east.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And your brother was okay?,A: My brother was okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did -- did you have s-separate roo -- I mean, ha -- what were your accommodations like when you were staying with your -- your mother's sister? Did you have separate rooms, or what?","A: No, no, we -- the accommodations were, I think we slept in the kitchen, and they slept in the bedroom.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. So they had a small home.,"A: Yes. ontactrefiranneGaushariarg a hither atrmedortabeattfiexaliaton Interview with Maurice Friedberg 6 August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. Did your father get paid for this work?,"A: He got paid some, in the form of food rations, military rations.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Uh-huh. Now, your mother didn't work, I gather?",A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. And what was your -- the husband of your mother's sister, what work did he do? Was he under the Russians also?","A: He was under the Russians also, and he tried to get some government approved work, but they didn't get around to it.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Were you, by the way, as a-- I mean, now you are 10 years old.",A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right? Or 11 years old.,A: 10 --te -- 10 years old.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yes. Were you frightened about going back to Poland, or did you not think about that?",A: I didn't think about that.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You didn't. So, was there talk about what the Nazis were doing, what the --","A: No, the Nazis were not doing --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They weren't doing much.,A: They were not doing much that early in the game.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. So nobody was that afraid.,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. Okay, so the Russians take you, they claim that they're gonna send you back to Poland, but they don't.",A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So they send you east instead of west.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And where do you -- and what's the -- what's the train like?,"A: The train was, oh about 15 or 20 car -- cars filled with people, and locked. And inside you had a hole so you could pee in -- in it. But other than that, again, there was nothing special, except that they distributed a little water to drink, and a little bread to eat.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Were you fr -- was this a frightening time for you?,"A: Yes, it was already, because we didn't know where we were -- where we were going, and why we are being sent there, and what we have to do once we arrive.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you're -- and you're with your -- your brother and your mother and your father?,A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Were you also with your mother's sister and her --,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They had se --,A: Because -- because she was considered a Soviet citizen --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see.,A: -- without any question.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. So she could stay there.,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. Do you -- do you remember your parents being nervous?,"A: Yes, of course they were nervous, but so was everybody else.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: And the assumption was that whatever happens to the rest of us will happen to us, and we can do nothing to change it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh. So do you remember how -- about how long the trip was in the --,A: The trip was about -- the trip was about -- close to two weeks.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Two weeks?,"A: Yes, because very often we would arrive at a junction, and they would just leave us there for a day or two.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Outside of the cattle car or inside?,"A: No, inside.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Inside?,A: Inside the cattle car.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Really?,"A: I mean, I was there -- I was there after the end of the Soviet regime. So we went to the -- the Yekaterinburg province, not too far from the large city of Tyumen, and within that, there was a lumber procurement barracks, and that's where I got -- they left us. They got us all together and they said, you'll be working here on procurement of lumber for the needs of the Soviet state. And you better get it in your mind that if you work hard, we'll feed you. If you don't work hard, we won't feed you, and then you'II starve to death and we'll bury you here, because there is plenty1 Interview with Maurice Friedberg August 12, 2009 of room for all of you, and that is the way it is with people who are trying to resist the needs of the Soviet state.","[1, 2, 3]"

And as he was saying his prayers, the KGB or NKVD or secret police commander came in, took out a watch from his pocket, and said there is no way you will get to work on time.So we are going to send you to a different camp.

She said that she lived not too far from where the deportees lived.And the -- she knew that the deportees from Poland lived in this camp, not too far away from them, but she could do nothing for them, and she heard that ultimately they were allo -- allowed to go back to Poland after World War II.

And since he found the classes boring, he adorned Krupskaya with a moustache and a few other parts of masculine rather than feminine -- masculine rather than -- than feminine appearance.

Q: And do you remember what she did?,"A: She did, I think -- she was peeling potatoes, which were then cooked and which was the main source of nourishment.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: I see. So your daily ration was potatoes.,A: Right. And -- and a piece of bread.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,A: And it -- and it was there that malnutrition resulted in me getting the jaundice.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Can you explain what that was like? What is jaundice?,"A: Jaundice is a -- an illness caused by malnutrition, and you -- the sign i -- of it is that the whites of your eyes turn yellow. Now the whites of my eyes turnedInterview with Maurice Friedberg "" August 12, 2009 practically brown, because I did not have the kind of food or medication that you use to treat jaundice. And for entertainment I will go outside the barracks because a few people there were to dig a grave for me. And so they would try and do it on the warmer days. You know, they would start the fire, and then the soil that was under the fire was warm enough for digging. Well, they never got around to burying me. I managed somehow to escape death, but the result of the jaundice is something that -- that I had for years and years later, because the art -- the jaundice that was not cured, resulted in problems with my -- what is -- what is the -- wi-with-with ma -- problems with -- with my li-liver, and th-the other thing which -- gall bladder. So there was enough of damage done -- done to those two things so that years later I was exempted from military service, because of problems with liver and with gall bladder which require a special diet and medication.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I see. And what was the effect, besides the -- the physical effect of your -- your -- the whites of your eyes going brown, what was the effect of the jaundice on you? Do you remember?","A: Yes, it was -- it -- it -- it gave me intermittent gall -- gall bladder and -- and liver fever. And that was it. And the assumption was that if you didn't take care of that with medication and proper diet, you would die.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right. But you didn't.,"A: But I didn't. Interview with Maurice Friedberg *deg August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you went outside to watch these people digging a grave for you?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Then wa -- what did you say to them?,A: Nothing.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Nothing. You just watched them.,A: I just watched them.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see.,"A: And I remember -- and I remember in the first few days after the Nazis entered Jaroslaw, Hitler came to see how Jaroslaw under the Nazis managed to live. And the -- and orders went out that on such and such a date, under the penalty of execution, nobody was to be close to a window. And -- but I -- but I was not going to obey this order, because there was an important thing for me to ascertain. The important thing was that when the Nazis s-scream heil Hitler, whether Hitler will scream heil ich. And Hitler did not scream heil ich, he replied heil sieg, you know.Long -- long live victory. And that was it, and nobody caught me, so I did not face penalty of death.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: And we were in that camp on the border of Siberia, in the Urals until a few days after the attack of Germany on the Soviet Union, which was June 22, 1941. And overnight, they decided that we should no longer be confined to camps, but weInterview with Maurice Friedberg * August 12, 2009 should be allowed to live outside of camps, except only for specific large cities and military objects. And so they told us to get the hell out of the camp. And since we were all freezing in those camps, the decision that was made immediately was that whatever it is, we shall try and escape Siberia, the Urals and go to a warmer climate. And I remember somebody got a map, and on this map we circled those towns where we wanted to go. And one of those towns was Jambol. Jambol which right now has reverted to its pre-revolutionary name, Taras. Jambol himself was a -- was a folk singer specializing in obsequious odes to Stalin and all his henchmen.Now, the name of -- of Taras is the one that you may have heard the last few days here, because it was the name of the -- of the [indecipherable] who lived -- who lived on the other side of the frontier between the U.S.S.R and China, where they still live.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: That was it.,"A: That was it. I saw this after the collapse of the Soviet regime, when I went to Omsk in Siberia. We stayed in a hotel, and th-there was steady -- there was snow the height of -- of five foot eight, five foot nine, and nobody ever tried to clean it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: -- when you were -- when you were there?,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So how did you get out of the barracks?,A: Because they would dig up a -- enough snow so that you could go out one by one.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So you could go out in line, sort of.",A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Was this a bad time for you in Sverdlovsk, that you remember?","A: Yes, it was a bad time because we were all starving.

Q: Right.,A: And we were allowed to go to Jambol.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. Were you -- when it -- when you were in Sverdlovsk, did you get any communication from relatives in Poland? Do you remember?","A: We got a few postcards, which were sent from German occupied Poland, but not very much.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you didn't know very much about what was going on?,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Did you hear rumors, do you remember, as a kid?","A: We heard rumors, but we were not sure whether the rumors are correct. One rumor that reached us was that Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, because the Soviets were afraid that Trotsky may offer some valuable assistance to the Germans, and they really expected the Germans to attack the Soviet Union.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They did?,"A: Yes, even though -- even though the official line was that the Germans are our -- are our allies.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But what you know from history is that Stalin was -- was -- seemed not to be wanting to hear this.,A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,A: But they just gave us a certificate saying that so and so was released from this and this camp by the authorities in accordance with the lo -- with the rule -- with -- with the decision of the council of ministers on such and such a date.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Right. So did -- did a lot of people go to Jambol from this camp?,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They did?,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Hundreds?,"A: I would say so. And a few of them are still in the United States. Interview with Maurice Friedberg "" August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: They are?,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: This was a very long trip, I would gather --",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: You're welcome.,"A: And in Jambol you also have other deportees from other places, quite a few from the Caucasus, where the Germans were advancing and the Soviets were deporting native s-speakers of languages of the Caucasus, because they were sure that they would greet the arrival of the Germans with joy.

Q: So it's a big mixture of people.,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: A lot of Jewish deportees from Poland.,"A: Oh yes, a lot of Jewish deportees from Poland. Interview with Maurice Friedberg 8 August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What did you eat on this train trip? Did you have food?,"A: We had some food, which we exchanged on the way, from local population. You know, we would -- we would exchange a watch for a loaf of bread.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Again?,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Now, was this the same kind of cattle car, were there no seats, and everybody's standing or sitting on the floor?","A: That's correct, that's correct, except that this time there were no -- there were -- there were no guards with rifles on the ready.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you weren't frightened in the same way?,"A: No, because we were told that we are now free, whereas the first time they didn't tell us if we are free --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right, right.",A: -- and we were -- we were guarded by po -- by police. And this time there weren't any guards.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Were you afraid that the Nazi movement into the Soviet Union would come south, or you didn't think about it?","A: I didn't think about it, and it was far, far away, and the news we were getting from war communiques provided no clue of the direction or success of German penetration of Russia.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Uh-huh. So in some ways you were going south in ignorance, you -- you --",A: That's correct.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You knew it would be warmer.,"A: Yes, and that if you are -- if you -- if warmer, there -- there is a little more food because you have food from what was grown the previous summer.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Right. I've just been touched, so let's -- let's cut the film, and we'll change it. Q: Do you remember the countryside that you saw on the way on the train, or do -- were -- or were there no windows, or where there's a little slat in the cattle car?","A: Iremember some, but not much.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Uh-huh, so you didn't look much?",A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And you were pretty short. It would have been tough to get up there, I would suspect.","A: That's correct, that's correct.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So when you arrive in Jambol, what -- what is it like? You get off the train, what happens?","A: And you look for a place to live. And so one place that was very popular was called Torgsin, spelled t-o-r-g-s-i-n, which is an abrogation of trading with foreigners. It was a Soviet institution that would exchange valuables that foreigners may have had, for things that you couldn't otherwise get, such as food, such as clothing. And so there was a flourishing black market of people trying to get those things that they could exchange later for food or black market. Did I make it clear?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm.,"A: And th -- that's one thing, and the other thing was finding quickly a place to sleep, to -- you know, you -- we -- we arrived there in the fall, which was not very cold, andontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Maurice Friedberg "" August 12, 2009 we were looking for a place to sleep. And of course, the locals, who could -- who could provide a place to sleep wanted to get paid in either gold or valuables that could be exchanged. And so we found one place to sleep with a local Kazakh who had -- who was starving. And I remember he was starving, but so was his dog, and he didn't have anything to give to the dog, and the dog ultimately died of hunger. And we lived in an extra room that he had in his house, for a while. And the way -- and the way we lived is that my -- my father would get somebody who would give him things that you can exchange for food or -- or other necessities. And I went to school.There was a normal Russian school there, which was run by the Siberian railroad -- si -- siber -- Siberian -- Si-Siberian Central Asian Railroad. And so I went to that school, and again I was starved. But you had to go to that school because there was nothing else for me to do. Occasionally I would help my father by c-carrying on my person, those things that he thought would be very dangerous if found on his person.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Like what?,"A: Like golden coins from pre-Soviet era, or golden wedding rings and sa -- and such things.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And -- and where did he get those things from?,A: From people who wanted to be paid in -- in -- in food and clothing and other necessities.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So he would make the exchange and bring them back?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how would he be -- how would he then be paid?,A: By getting a certain percentage of it.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I see. And when did you get cured of jaundice, before you went to Jambol?",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And it -- it didn't come back?,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: And was school a little bit more interesting here, or not?",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Why?,"A: Because you had teachers who were professional teachers, and there was a wider variety of -- of subject matter, and also there was -- the school had a library, so I could get some books from the library and then exchange them for other books.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I see. And did you talk about school when you came home and talked to your parents, or no -- or not?",A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You didn't.,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Was there anti-Semitism that you remember in Jambol?,"A: Oh, yes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: There were.,A: Violent anti-Semitism.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What does that mean?,"A: Well, it means that they would beat up people they thought were Jewish. They will say that we will not rent any living quarters to Jews. If Jews offer something for exchange, it means they are going to cheat you. Jews don't get drafted into the army, which was not true. Things like that.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: -- because you were being beaten up, what did you think about being Bar Mitzvahed? Was this a good thing, in fa -- in your eyes?","A: That was a good thing because it was the thing to do if you were Jewish. And since being Jewish was not a matter of choice, you may as well do it.","[1, 2, 3]"

And the Polish school was allowed to receive some support from [indecipherable] in the form of -- of grits or -- or some other thing that they could cook, and they could give you a portion of it for lunch. And in this respect it was better to be a student in the Polish school than in the state Russian school. The Russian school did not enjoy any special privileges and the Polish school did.

Q: It was the s -- it was the same kind of --,"A: It was the same kind, except that -- except that the 1945, the postwar anti- Semitism was made more acceptable because the war taught the Poles that to -- that you may kill Jews with impunity.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: And do you explain that because everybody was suffering from the war itself, or",A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Mm-hm. Did you have a weapon that you carried around with you at that ti-- at that point?,"A: Yes. Yes, I did, because the police would occasionally close its eyes to the fact that the Jews had weapons, because they could not provide them with protection 24 hours a day. So they would say, if you have a gun, we will not kill you for it. You know, and -- and you could find guns all over the place.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: And th-th-they were fine with this?,A: Right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did they have one as well?,"A: No. But that's the place where the pogroms began. You know, there was one pogrom that never took place, because we were told that there would be one. And soInterview with Maurice Friedberg "" August 12, 2009 we organized a defense organization. And I remember that before Passover 1946, I went out of the house where the Jews lived, and I saw a carton with something in it.So I walked over to it to see what it is. And I saw a newborn child cut into little pieces in that car-carton. And I took the carton away with a couple of other kids, and we hid it. And within minutes, there was a large group of local people looking for something. They were obviously looking for that carton, but finding none, they went back and disappeared. And this was the -- the pogrom that never was realized in Krakow. But an-another gos -- pogrom in Kielce did take place, and there were about 70 or 80 Jews who were killed in that pogrom. And there -- there was -- and that -- there was a press conference in the -- with -- with the -- with the archbishop of Krakow, and I went to that press conference and I heard one journalist ask, is it true that the Jews use Christian blood to make matzoh?

Q: -- say we're going?,"A: They said we are going, they said, we don't want to be the last Jews alive in Poland.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hm. Was it easy to leave?,"A: Yes, because the Polish government wanted the Jews out, because they were a se --a security drain, and also because they knew that the Jews will be an excuse for anti-Soviet, anti-communist activity.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: What do you mean that the Jews were a security drain, what does that mean?",A: That they would have to assign so many policemen to protect the places where the Jews lived.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: -- difficult situation, or --","A: It's difficult, because you could not get a working permit, because the French suffered from unemployment. So they would allow Jews, refugees, to work only in three or four professions, where there was no unemployment. See what I mean?","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Mm-hm, right. So -- and that wasn't a great number of spots, I would gather.","A: That's correct. But we were all waiting for the opportunity to leave France for the United States or Canada. I mean, there was no state of Israel yet.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: He's not?,"A: No, because there was no -- there was no work where you could get a job where you were allowed to work. So we were just waiting for the opportunity to get the hell out of there.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So that's difficult, it's two years like this.","A: Yes, I know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Do you go to school at all?,"A: Yes, I did.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Even if it's -- they're not the best.,A: That's correct. But --,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: -- you're 17 years old. Is there more to do, or is the situation so bad because of the ravages of war?","A: No, I think because of the first. But again, there was no clear line of demarcation between the two. And there were always rumors, you know, that within a week, they will allow Jews to leave for, say Venezuela. Which they did.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: Except that you were allowed to go to Venezuela, provided you lied about your religion, with the connivance of the Venezuelan government, which allowed only white, Christian immigration.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But they knew that people were lying?,"A: They knew that people were lying, and -- and the train to where the boats for Venezuela were, were paid for and organized by the Jewish organizations from America.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Now when you get to Paris, do you very quickly try to get visas?","A: We did, but that was of no avail, because visas were usual -- usually given to categories of people rather than individuals.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And what were the categories?,"A: The categories were those who lied about their religion, and who lied about their economic status, or what they could contribute to Venezuela.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And -- but you immediately applied to go to the United States, is that correct?","A: We did, but they told us that this takes time. So do you want to leave now for Venezuela or await better luck with visa applications to America?","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Mm-hm. And you had to wait two years.,"A: Mm-hm. Interview with Maurice Friedberg ia August 12, 2009","[1, 2, 3]"

One was on Rue de Roi de Sicile, the street of the king of Sicily, which was in a section known as Le Marais, Metro Saint-Paul, between Bastille and -- and the -- and the Louvre and Rue Rivoli.
