Q: Where they well-off or...,"A: Yeah. I mean, they had a car. In those days very few people had a car. He had a little business. And, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying how rich they were but they had an apartment, one bedroom, a living room, dining room, you know. They were not poor, but I wouldn't say they were rich, but they were comfortable. And -- but before we turned around it was December and it was Christmas and the doorbell rang. When she opened the door her brother was there in an SS uniform, younger brother. So he wanted to spend Christmas Eve with them. He was probably stationed nearby and he needed a place to spend the evening. So they went into the dining room and he was -- she says, quickly, quick go to the bathroom. Lock the door. Don't make a light. Don't even breathe. She was so afraid of him. So he went in and he was drinking and drinking and singing all the German songs. Oh salute, you know. And he must have been so drunk.

Okay -- in German, of course, he's going. I said, thank God. All of a sudden he said, okay. Okay. One more for the road. And back to the another drink, another drink. She wanted to get rid of him already. Finally, he left. She knocked on the door of the bathroom. She said, okay. Girls, you can come out now. We opened the door, we couldn't see a thing because we had been so many hours in the dark. No window, no light. I felt like blinded until I could open my eyes. So she says, I'm so sorry. I don't know if I can keep you any longer. My brother could come anytime unexpected. I mean, I understood this, but what could Ido? Again, we were on the go. But he said, don't worry. I made an application for both of you for the Kindertransport. He says that I heard that England opened up visas. He told us this at the beginning when we first came. I forgot about this. So he says, England opened up visas for 10,000 children up to 16. And I was 14 and my sister was 16. 16 she could still go. So he says, and I'm sure you will both qualify, you're orphans, you're homeless, they should take you first, right? But anyhow from the time he made the application and he says -- well, when we had to leave there he didn't throw us out, but we had to go. What about if her brother comes back and sees us there? So, again, we had to go. Whoever took us in. So then he says, well, I'm sure it will soon come through. You'll be going to England very soon. Wouldn't take long. But do you know how long it took? Nine months. Next year we first had the apply -- the letter in July. I can go to England but my sister's birthday was in May. She was two months too old. If you would have gotten it in May she could go. But she was two months too old. They came in July and they gave you a whole list what I could take. Only two pairs of shoes, two pairs of this.

Q: Do you remember crossing the border?,"A: Yes. Fritzi and I, we were sitting and we were looking out the window. And on the other side were two little kids, maybe seven, eight years old. I didn't know them. And we didn't even talk to them. We were just talking to each other. I didn't see her in a year, you know, or any of my schoolmates. So anyhow. So, you know, in the city in Berlin there's only, like, big buildings, cement floors. You don't see trees or grass or anything unless you go to the park. So as we were going, didn't take long, you're out of the city and you see the suburbs. And there was grass and trees, little houses. So Fritzi said to me, isn't it like you're going on a field trip from school and tonight we'll be back home in our house with parents -- with our parents? So I said to -- I thought to myself, well, she still had a home to go to and a mother but I didn't. But I didn't want to make her feel bad so I just nodded my head. I said, uh-huh, uh-huh, like this. And then as we were going, all of a sudden the train stopped. I said, what happened? Looked out the window and I saw the Gestapo outside. I said uh-oh. Now they're going to come and take us off the train. And I was scared like anything. But I didn't realize -- I forgot we were going through Holland. So then I realized this must be the border because they came on. It was a border crossing. So they had to come on and look at your passport. So he says, passports, passports. You know, young guys in Nazi uniform. So I got up and I took my little suitcase down. So you know what he said? Forget about it. He didn't want to look.I could have taken anything with me. I was like -- but my sister was, like, she took everything. Boy, what they did to her. Well, anyhow. We crossed the border. It took 15, 20 minutes we cross the border. I said, thank God I'm out of Germany. Now I don't have to worry anymore once you're out of the country. But we were going for a while and all of a sudden the train stopped again. I said, what? Another border from Holland?We're going straight through the channel. But when I looked up there was no Gestapo outside. They were Dutch women with baskets of food. I still cry when I hear about this.I got a tissue, you know. So they knew the children were coming so they brought us refreshments. Wasn't that wonder -- perfect strangers they came on the train. Wasn't that something? I never forget this. And then we traveled to Holland until the rest of the day.About 10 o'clock we got off the train that day. And we were by the -- by the British channel. And then they lined us up, make sure everybody was -- I think there were 300 children on that train from the connection spot. And they said, well, I want everybody to go straight to the cabin where they're assigned to. And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock we got there. The boat is not going to start going until 12. But don't wait for 12 o'clock because six o'clock in the morning if you're going to be in Harwich and you have to be packed and upstairs ready to go. So go right to bed. Don't wait for 12 o'clock until the boat leaves. And when we got on the boat, Fritzi and I, we shared a cabin. So they had a bunk and a top one. We had to toss a coin, which one gets the top and which one gets the bottom. That was so cute, you know. We were just kids. And anyhow she slept on the top. And as we went to bed she kept talking. She says, are you sleeping? I said, how can I sleep when you're talking to me? You know, we're just talking like kids. Teenagers, early teens, you know. So anyhow. So all of a sudden after a while the boat started rocking. Uh-oh, it must be 12 o'clock because the boat starting going. He said 12 o'clock it's going to start. So it must be two hours already. Better go to sleep. Six o'clock we have to be upstairs. So we must have fallen asleep or something. And then in the morning we got up and we were in Harwich. And from there we took a train to London.It took two hours. And then when we got to London there was, like, a big room, a little bigger than this maybe. A little wider. And there was, like, a bench here and a bench there and there. And we were sitting on those benches and some people came and they called out names. You go with this person. You go with -- nobody knew where they were going. I had no address and I still like to look for this girl. I wish I knew if she's alive, if she's in England or some place else. I never saw her since that day. Because I didn't know where I was going and she didn't know where she was going.","{

Q: Was it in London?,"A: In London, yeah. I met the family over -- they had a married son, two or three kids; and a married daughter with some children. And then the youngest daughter was, like, in her 20s. And she was -- I didn't even know at the time she was expecting her first baby. But it wasn't hardly to see. And at that time I didn't even know where the babies came from. Now, I do. Anyhow. So -- so on the weekend I met them and then on -- she says to me, well, what are you going to do with yourself? You know, it was July. The schools were closed. So she said, well, when the schools open in September, we going to register you for school. So in the meantime what are you going to do with yourself? And they had their own -- like, a little factory. They were making civilian trousers for men. So Monday morning the younger daughter that was working in that place for her father, you know, there were a few people there. They were, like, a few men and one woman. They were in their 50s or 60s, you know. Like, four or five men and one woman was right on the corner. She was, like, 64. They were very nice to me. But they spoke Yiddish. I couldn't speak any English. So they spoke Yiddish to me. I understood but I didn't speak it that good. But it's very similar to German. So I knew what they were saying. So she introduced me to everybody and she showed me what to do. How to use this machine and this machine. A few machines she taught me at my age, you know. I never worked. I had to sew the buttons with the machine. And if you don't put it exactly in and the needle went next to the hole, you break the needles. I must have broke a dozen needles. It was very hard to get it the right way. And she was so fast because she's been used to it, you know. And then there was another machine that made the hems and another machine for the buttonholes. I had to work all three machines, and make tea twice a day for everybody who was there. I still hate te","{

Q: Was it in London?,"A: It reminds me. So anyhow I was working with her and she used to take me there in the morning. | think we went by bus. And then I came home in the evening. And before I had dinner she used to say to me -- there was only her and her husband living there -- she said, while the dinner is -- while you're waiting you can wash this floor. She made me do the housework before -- after a whole day in the factory. Well, anyhow -- but then this was going on for quite a few months.September came around. I forgot about it school. You know, and nobody mentioned a word. And I was just working, working every day. But then she was getting ready to have her baby. And her name was Fannie. And so she says, well -- when she couldn't go to work anymore I was on my own. And then all the work what the two of us did I had to do myself. So instead of going at nine o'clock in the morning I had to go eight o'clock and seven o'clock. And instead of staying until five or six, I used to stay until seven, eight o'clock. Five days, six days, seven days a week, I couldn't keep up. And I don't know what happened. One day I remember I was going to the bus and the bus ride was tuppence. Know anything about English money? Tuppence is like 20 cents. So she used to give me the tuppence. But then she found out they have -- what is this -- you know, if you come until 7:30 -- before 7:30 in the morning you get a return ticket. So if you give them tuppence and a half, Ha'penny, you get a ticket to go back at night. So she says,make sure you get the bus before 7:30. And she gave me tuppence and a half, the Ha'penny. And that's all the money I had. I never had pocket money or wages or anything, only food and sleep, lodging. So I tried to get the bus -- every time I came to the bus, there was a line from here to God knows where. All these big guys waiting for the bus. They probably had families to support. They saw me, they said, that kid's probably working for pocket money and they used to push me on the side and get on the bus. And I tried to get on the bus but I couldn't push those guys away. I was trying to get very hard. If I was lucky I got on it and I had my ticket to go back home. But I remember one day I tried so hard and they pushed me on the side. And -- there be another bus in a minute. Half a minute later the bus came, no more return. What I'm going to do? I had to give them the tuppence and I had a Ha'penny left. I came to the place and I was crying. So the woman that was working, the one woman, she says to me, what's the matter, Puppala? Puppala means little doll. Why are you crying? So I said, I missed the return bus this morning. So she said, big deal. So you're five minutes late? I said, no, no, no, no, no. It's not I'm late, I have no money to go back home. She said, what it is tuppence? Big deal. Here's tuppence. And I made a Ha'penny that day. That's the first money I ever had of my own. Isn't that something? I cried because I didn't make the return bus. But I didn't tell her that.","{

Q: And what happened?,"A: And I'm laying on the bed or stretcher and the young doctor bending over me and talking to me. I couldn't understand a word he was saying because I didn't go to school.Nobody spoke English to me. I was already, like, a halfa year in England. IfI go to school I would have spoken -- or people speak to you I would know a little English, but nobody spoke English to me. I didn't go to school so I didn't know any English. And he was talking and talking. I didn't know what he was saying. So he didn't know what to dowith me. Couldn't even tell me how I feel, why I -- I don't know what happened. I didn't even remember fainting or anything. All I remember is -- was I was hot. It was just before Christmas. This I remember because Father Christmas came. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.That's how I remember what time of the year it was. So he didn't know what to do with me so they put me in a big room like a ward with about eight or 10 people, woman, there all the way in the corner on one bed and they called somebody from the Bloomsbury House. That's the organization that was responsible for the children, Kindertransport children. So after a while a Ms. Feldman came to me see me and she spoke to me in German. And she says to me, how come you don't speak any English? You're here already a long time. I mean, half a year is a long time to learn English, right? At least a few words. So I said, nobody speaks English to me, how can I learn? So she said, well, don't you go to school? I said, oh, my God, school. I forgot what school is such a long time. Like, a year and a half I haven't been in school. So she says, what are you doing with yourself all day long if you don't go to school? So I said, well, I work in the factory.She says, well, do you have a permit? I said, what's that? I don't know what a permit is.So she said, well, whenever we came we check up on our children and whenever we came to your house the lady always said, she's in school. And when they came on the weekend I was never there. She's out with a friend. They probably went to a movie or something. Because I was never there whenever they came to check up on me.

But the people my sister was staying with -- I don't know if they had a place in the country or they rented, I don't know. But they couldn't take the bombs going every night to the shelter. Because I didn't even know what it was like to sleep in a bed anymore. For three years, four years, you know, I haven't slept in the bed. So they went to the country and they took her along. So I -- then I couldn't see her at all anymore. So I -- I don't know if I knew any of this but I told this Ms. Feldman and they must have made the arrangements. So anyhow. So my sister wrote a letter to me to the hospital. And they wouldn't let me out of the hospital. And Ms. Feldman said, the only way we can release her is if a person that's already of age.

See, first of all, the bombs and all this is bad, but I have no choice you're there too. I was sleeping with the bombs every night.But what am I going to do? I have no occupation. The only thing I know is cleaning houses. That's the only thing I know. That's what she came there for. Domestic service.So I said, but I know how to work. I work all three machines, four machines, and I know -- and I can do -- so she says, but how am I going to make a living? I said, don't worry. I know how to work. I'll teach you. So that's the only way they'll let me out. So she had to come to London. Take a risk being in London under the Blitz instead of being safe in the country. And so we rented a room and Ms. Feldman helped us a lot. She says, as long as you're in this country you're my child no matter how old you are.
