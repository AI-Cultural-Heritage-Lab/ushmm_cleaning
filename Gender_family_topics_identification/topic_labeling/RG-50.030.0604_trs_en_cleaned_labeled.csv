I was born in Breslau to -- to Arnold and Elsa Wolff, who lived in Reichenbach,where my father had an interest in a sawmill. I was very young when I left Germany. Idon't have any recollection of the size of the town. The reason I was born in Breslau isthat my father did not like the clinic in Reichenbach so he sent my mother to Breslau, butwe actually lived in Reichenbach. As far as the town, I have no memories at all because Iwas just -- I left just before my third birthday.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: So both of your parents were Jewish or just --,"A: Both of my parents were Jewish. My father was born into an orthodox family.

"Q: Would you describe your family as well off or middle class or, do you remember that?","A: I would -- I don't remember much, but my -- my feeling is there -- they werereasonably well off.

That's aboutthe extent of the -- of their religious activities for -- for various reasons. Shavuot wasnever a big thing in our house, but the Passover was very big always, always hadPassover, and they always attended services for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, and wedid almost nothing for Hanukkah, so that was basically it.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Sure.,"A: Of course in -- in early 1939 my mother's best friend sent her daughter Eva to be takenin by foster parents in Scotland, in Glasgow, Scotland, and my mother was unwilling tolet me go at that time. When -- by May she decided it was probably best if I go, so shemade arrangements for me to be adopted by the same family or by -- by a member of thatfamily in -- in -- also in Glasgow, Scotland.So in mid June, and I believe it's the 15th ofJune, but I'm not totally certain, she went to Berlin with me, and since I was -- I was twoweeks short of my third birthday, she was allowed to go on the train to -- to the -- to theship. So as a matter of fact the story she tells is that they had to stop the train becausea -- the head count was one over. They had counted her as one of the children. So oncethey got it straightened out we went to the -- shipboard, and she handed me over to one ofthe older girls, you know, please take care of my child, and that's how I got onto the ship.The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Wolff 6There were approximately 180. I don't know the name of the ship. She wouldn't -- it wasvery, very difficult for her to talk about it. You know, it was really hard, and she hadhanded me off on a ship. She thinks there were about 180 on it, and I was the youngest ofthe -- the group.When we got to London, Liverpool station, she had arranged -- with herusual thoroughness she had arranged for her -- one of her girlfriends who lived in Londonto meet me there, and I met this lady much later on in life and she told me that, youknow, she was the only person in the London station speaking German, so I grabbed ontoher and I wouldn't let go. Now, the family that adopted me in Glasgow, Mr. and Mrs.Ness, Mr. Ness came down to London in his car and picked me up, and sheactually -- this lady Elsa Weiss (ph), was her name, you know, made sure I got with him,and we went to Glasgow.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And what are your first recollections of --,"A: [remember the house in Glasgow. I don't remember anything about the trip, but I doremember the house in Glasgow. You know, I remember at the end we were at a deadend street. At the end of the street there was a hill, and across the hill was a railroad track,and the trains would always fascinate me going by. I remember Mr. Ness very well. Idon't remember Mrs. Ness, and I don't remember Anita, their daughter, who was twoyears older than I am, and I do remember him -- you know, they were very orthodox, andhe was -- he always put on his tefillin in the morning prayers, and I had my -- my buildingblocks, my wooden building blocks, and I would tie those on standing next to him and Iwould dove in with him, you know, kind of imitating him. That I remember.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Do you -- did you know the story, like how you came to England? Did they tell you The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript. It has not been checked for spelling nor verified for accuracy. This document should not be quoted or used without first checking it against the interview.","A: The -- my -- my -- you know, I pieced it together from my father. My father had asmall prayer book, and inside that prayer book he has -- he took notes from this wholething, you know, of when he was arrested in Christinenthal (ph) and where he was andwhen he got to England, so a lot of this stuff I pieced back from, you know, taking -- youknow, trying to get stuff out of my mother and from his notes in his prayer book, which Istill have.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, so your parents ended up also in England?","A: Not really, but let me go through with that.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Sure.,"A: Okay. According to my father's records, he came to -- he came to England in Augustof ""39. My mother -- back in Germany she was, you know, taking care of her father,who lived with her. She was -- took over the -- charge of the sawmill because the partnerwas also arrested. My father was arrested. The partner was arrested in Christinenthal (ph).They were sent to Doha (ph), and my mother had all this responsibility, so -- plus she wastrying to get him out of there, and if you had a visa to get out to anywhere youcould -- they would let you out, and, you know, a little money also under the table alsohelped. So in August of 1939 he came over to England, but he was not allowed to land inEngland per se. They kept him in what they called concentration camps at the time,which were actually work camps. He was on the Isle of Man, and then he was on severalother ones during his stay. They kept moving him around. He -- he came to see me, andthis is what I get from his notes. He came to see me, and of course I wouldn't -- I didn't The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 8 recognize him, and I denied that he was my father. He was trying to tell me he was my father. He came to visit me several times in Scotland. While this was going on my mother was applying for visas worldwide, anywhere that she could go, and the only place that would take her, the only visa she was able to get was in Bolivia, South America. So in early 1940 she left for Bolivia. Somehow they managed to keep in touch with each other constantly, and my father asked that she go through Italy and not through Holland because a lot of the ships out of Holland were being torpedoed. Well, she went through Holland, and not -- and not out of Italy, and irony would have it the ship out of Italy was sunk and the ship she was on, she made it to Bolivia. As soon as she got to Bolivia, she went to work for a Jewish lawyer, who happened to be the partner of a Bolivian senator, Dr. Bachnorsodo (ph), and through his help she got visas for my father and I to come and join her in Bolivia. We had -- Mr. Ness drove us down to Liverpool, and we had three hiccups so to speak. We got to Liverpool the first time and my father was late because they didn't release him on time, so we had to go back. We missed the boat. The second time they arrested my father because his papers were out of date, so we had to go back, and he was in jail, and then they finally got it straightened out. On the third time -- excuse me -- in late 1940, I think it was December 23rd, around there, we finally sailed for -- for South America. I remember very little about the crossing. I remember that I heard cannon fires, and I heard -- you know, we were on emergencies. I don't know if it was a drill or actually a boat sighting, but we -- we came through, and I remember a little bit of Bermuda. There was -- I remember very vividly there was a big ship model in -- ina window that I really wanted. You know, I was spoiled. I had a lot of toys in England, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 9 and, you know, my father, you know, he had basically two coins to rub together in his pocket, and it was -- there was a big tantrum. We went through the Panama Canal, went through -- you know, came down to Chile and to Bolivia, and I met this woman at the station in La Paz. You know, my mother hadn't seen me for a year and-a-half, and of course I didn't know her. You know, it was a strange woman. We -- we were very poor.When my father had the sawmill back in Germany, he built a series of about 12 or 13 boxes in which they put all their -- their goods in, big wooden boxes, and we went -- we managed to get one of them to Bolivia, and it happened to be linens and bedding, and she kept selling the linens and bedding to keep us going. My father finally found a job, which was out of town, in a sawmill, run by a fellow Jew. My mother was working for this -- Doctor Breeker (ph) was his name, you know, as a -- as a secretary or something like that, so I was in -- I was in day school, and sometimes I would stay with the Breekers (ph) in the evening. I can remember very little about the day school, but I do remember that for lunch every day we had this fruit compote, and even at that age I would pick the raisins out of the compote because I never liked them, so just that's what I remember.Eventually my father got job with a -- in a mining town, Potosi, which is very high up in the Andes, about 12, 14,000 feet up in the Andes, and so we moved to Potosi, and we stayed with -- the first place we stayed was with my mother's girlfriend from -- my mother's grammar school girlfriend. Her name was Erma (ph) Freed (ph), and they had an apartment. They let us stay there -- they had an extra bedroom -- until we got settled. Her and I were just -- you know, Erma was the total opposite of my mother. My mother was a very, very serious person, you know, very straight, and Erma was a total cutup, and we The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Wolff 10 would, you know, call each other names and pick at each other, and you know, do tricks to each other constantly, and we did this -- as long as she was alive we did this. And then we moved into a -- our own apartment, which is kind of an interesting apartment. We had a bedroom, a dining room and a kitchen, a very large kitchen, and the bathroom was -- I always tell this to my grandkids because they don't believe me, but the bathroom was across the patio, and it was shared by -- by three or four apartments. It did not have running water. It did not have any lights, so I always traipsed across the patio with my bucket to flush, my little board to sit on and toilet paper, a candle and matches. You know, it was a big trick. We -- like I say, there was -- the only running water we had was in the kitchen, and we would take a bath once a week, you know, in a big tub just like the farmers used to do, and you know, the water had to be boiled and the water had to be filtered because it came to town in open channels. It was pretty primitive. And I went to school, and I went to grammar school, and of course I stood out like a sore thumb. There was about three or four of us gringos in the school, and the first -- my first year there I got -- during one recess | got tripped up and broke my arm, so my parents didn't want me there. So they moved me to a Catholic school, which was really -- really across the street from our house, and I wasn't treated very well there. They -- you know, they -- they didn't like Jews, you know. They made me go to services. I got to kneel. I got to cross myself. I probably knew more about the Catholism than I did about the Jewish religion, but I survived. Later on my father became a manager up in the mine, up in his section of the mine, and they gave us company housing, so we moved out to -- to a place called Chaco, which was outside of town, and it was kind of far out. While I was in town we -- I was The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

Wolff 11going to Hebrew school once a week to learn a few -- a few things, but once we were outof town that was impossible because we didn't have a car, but it was a nice home. We hada really nice house, you know, compared to what we had before, and I went tothe -- the -- to the school, the company school, which had, I think, eight kids total, youknow, from all -- from first grade through -- through sixth, seventh -- sixth grade, so wewere in a company school. I started learning English again, which I had totally forgotten.My mother always kidded me. She says when I first got to Bolivia I spoke Spanish,English and German in one sentence until I -- you know, I lost the English and thenpicked up Spanish and the German. So I went to school there until the sixth grade,and then they sent me out of town to school in Aurora, which is a town approximately400 miles away, and I was at boarding school -- I was in boarding school and went to anAmerican school there. It was an Angelo-American school, which mainly teaches fromthe states, retired teachers from the states, spinsters mainly, and I was bar mitzvahedthere in town, and I -- I learned my Hebrew for, you know, a month -- two months before,and I forgot it two months afterwards, but it was -- it was interesting, the school. Mymother believed that -- you know, in Germany you wear short pants, so I had to wearshort pants. So my first year there I'm -- I'm taller than most kids, and I was -- I waswearing short pants, and that was -- that was terrible. That was just a really bad year. Thesecond year I grew into long pants, and, you know, I was one of the older kids so wewere pulling the tricks that had been pulled on me on the younger kids, so that was a littlebit better. You know, as soon as we got to Bolivia my -- my parents applied for a visa tocome to the United States, and my father was actually Polish quota.

Wolff 12Germany, but it became Poland after World War I, so they considered him Polish quota,so we applied right away. Now, the whole time we were in Bolivia my parents and theNess family were corresponding with each other. They kept in touch. You know, myparents kept -- you know, I don't know -- through the Elfbaugh (ph), which was thepublication for the German Jews basically, they kept -- I think it came out of New York.I'm pretty sure it was. They kept -- you know, you could put ads in there, you know,Arnold and Elsa Wolff from Reichenbach, Germany looking for their family and friends,and they -- they got in contact with all my -- all my uncles on my father's side and myaunt, and they -- they got in touch with a lot of their friends. So they -- they keptin -- they were big writers. They always wrote letters and always kept in touch, and theystill corresponded with the Ness family so -- while this was going on. In March of ""52 wefinally got okay to come, so we left Potosi and we went through Oruro to La Paz, whichwas a beautiful city, and then eventually to Arica, where we boarded the ship to come tothe states. We came up the West Coast of South America to the Panama Canal, and thefirst thing I saw -- actually Panama City was in United States territory. I saw first anAfrican-American speaking English, which just totally blew me away because in Bolivia,you know, the Mestizos and the Indians only spoke Ketroamina (ph). They didn't evenspeak Spanish, so that was a real surprise to me, and we flew to New Orleans and then toMemphis, Tennessee, where my mother had a cousin, and they -- they actually vouchedfor us, and that's how we got in. I went to high school there. Well, they put me back ayear because we got here in March. The -- the school year here was almost over, so theyput me back a grade, and they -- so I had to struggle with that.

I joined an AZA group, you know, the AZA group, leg of the B'naiB'rith, and I met a lot of kids and a lot of friends. My father was having a hard timewith -- with the heat in Memphis. He had arthritis and it was bothering him a lot, and,you know, jobs were hard to get, so my mother had another cousin in San Francisco, andmy father decided he was going to go to San Francisco, so he went ahead of us.Sometime, I believe, in March or April of ""53, went to San Francisco, found a job andfound -- found a place for us to stay with a Jewish -- a boarding -- like a board house typeof thing. So in June -- as soon as school was out in June of ""53 my mother and I followedhim. We -- you know, we railroaded across the country into San Francisco, and there Iagain joined another a see AZA chapter. Some of those -- some of my friends from theAZA chapter I'm still in touch with today, and that was a good experience for me. Thatwas really very interesting for me, and I went to high school there, and all this time -- oh,actually I forgot -- I forgot to mention that while we were in Memphis Mr. and Mrs. Nesswere coming to New York, and they wanted my parents to -- to meet -- you know, bringme up there so they could see me, and my parents had just arrived in the country. Theyboth had new jobs, and we really didn't have any money to -- to -- to spend on a trip. Somy parents, you know, were denied -- refused them, and they were very angry. Theyhad -- you know, they really wanted to see me.

I lived in Concord, worked in Pittsburgh, and then I got drafted. What had happened is, I went to work for Pacific Gas Electric because of getting deferments from the Army and as soon as I got there they cut out the deferments so I got drafted. So I went to Fort Ord for, you know, three months for basic training, and then on the way to -- to Dugway, Utah, where I was going to be stationed, I picked up my wife in San Francisco and we went on, and it was -- it was kind of interesting. We got to this -- you know, we got to Salt Lake City on a Sunday morning, didn't know a sole, you know, found a soldier, and he was going up to Dugway, and so we got on here and we -- we drive out of Salt Lake City, and we drive for miles and miles and finally come to a little town, and all we could see was a snowbank because it had snowed for a while, and he said this is where you're going to live because there is no house on the post, and then we drive for another hour and we come to this gate in the middle of the desert, and, you know, what is this. We finally got to the main post, and sure enough I -- we couldn't get -- we couldn't get any on post housing, and we ended up in a little dinky basement apartment in town, and I had -- I had to commute back and forth, usually on the bus, and you had to get up at five in the morning and walk over to the bus. It was always icy and slippery. So half the time I was on my -- sitting on my butt trying to get to the bus, and we went there, and we stayed there for a couple years.

They extended us because they had a problem in Berlin, and we settled in -- inOrange County, California, and my -- my daughter was born there, and eventually Igot -- I got tired of Orange County. You know, it's just too crowded, too many people.I'm very impatient. I don't like to wait. Every time you went to a restaurant you had towait in line. Every time you went to a show you had to wait in line, so I started lookingaround and I found a job in Santa Barbara. So in -- in May of 1970 I went up to SantaBarbara and stayed in a private home, just rented a bedroom and stayed there for -- forthree or four months until we found a house, and eventually my wife and the kids cameup and we settled in Santa Barbara. All this time I was still corresponding with theNesses, but the -- you know, my parents had stopped because they were mad at them.The Nesses were mad at my parents, and my -- you know, I eventually lost contact withthem. They -- you know, letters didn't -- weren't -- there was no response to me, soin -- you know, the next thing that happened, my parents moved down to Orange Countyto -- to -- you know, to leisure world, and so they were close. We always visited them.We always had Passover with them, but, you know, they lived a little bit away so we onlysaw them three or four times a year maybe. And fast forward to 1992. I have a bunch ofpeople -- a bunch of friends that we go to lunch with. We go to lunch almost everyday -- every weekday, and we've been doing this since 1971. So on this day in 1992 oneof the guys was -- who happened to be my dentist, came to lunch, and he was one of ourregulars, and he brought another fellow, Bob, who I also know, and Bob makes the The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

They got out of his house and out of theirhair, and I asked him, I said, where in Scotland, and he says Glasgow, and I said, well,you know, next time your wife talks to her relatives have them find out what happened tothe Ness girl. This is Anita Ness, the daughter of the couple that adopted me, andshe -- he said okay, well, I'll do it, and I forgot about it. Three, four days later I get aphone call. He says I got a phone number for you, and this is Sunday night about 6:00, soobviously I can't call. You know, 5:00 Monday morning the phone rings. It's Anita,where have you been? Why haven't you called me? I said, I didn't know your name. Yougot married. I didn't know your married name. So we started corresponding, and inmid -- in the summer of ""92 my wife and I went over there. She insisted that -- you know,that we stay with her, and she wanted to go on the trip with us, and I said -- I told Lani, Isaid, well, let's -- let's just see how it goes. We actually came into London. We stayed inLondon for a week, and her son, Richard, picked me up, picked us up and took us todinner at their home, which was very nice. They had two children. Lauren and Jonathanwere the two kids, and, you know, we got along fine. Everything was fine, and then wefinally took the train up to -- up to Scotland, and Anita is -- is a strange bird. She's verynervous, I don't know, very sheltered person is, I guess, the best way to put it. So, youknow, she met us, but she was real scared to death, maybe we have two heads or we'reweird or something, but everything worked out fine. We got along fine. She got a reportfrom her son so she wasn't quite as nervous as she should be, but she -- she was -- shewas okay with it, and we -- we stayed with her at the flat, and I got to meet -- you know, The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

They were all older than I am, and Iwas told how I used to bite Anita. I was told, you know, I had a purse and I used to hither with it, and the thing that really, really bothered me was that when I left her motherlost her child, so her mother was really upset when I had left. And one thing we learnedjust this year when we were back in London, from Anita, is that when I -- when my fathercame to -- when Mr. Ness took me away, they had -- Anita was out of the house.They -- they -- they took her someplace so she wouldn't see the departure, so shewouldn't, you know, get sad at me leaving, and I just found that out this year. I didn'tknow about that before. Anyway, we -- you know, like I say, we met the family, and Iwas -- I was really unhappy that I, you know, caused that much pain to the mother. It justnever occurred to me. Why I don't know, and the night before we left for England mymother had called me and she says find out what happened to Eva. That was a little girlthat went ahead of me in 1939, and I said, who is Eva? That's the first I ever heard aboutit. So she told me. So I -- Eva was there in Glasgow at this -- this party. She was one ofthe cousins. Her parents didn't make it through, so she -- she stayed there, and she is, youknow, the child of the family that adopted her. So that was -- that worked out very nice.It was -- it was a pretty good reunion, and, you know -- you know, we keep in touch stillto this day, and I finally convinced Anita that -- to come to the states a couple years later.So in 1995, scared to death to fly, just actually petrified of flying, she and Eva came, andwe -- you know, we went all over. We went to San Francisco, went to Vegas, went toDisneyland. They wouldn't even get on the people mover at Disneyland. That's how The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I couldn't get -- my mother, you know,really wouldn't talk about it. She did get the Spielberg tapes, very, very reluctantly andnever watched them. She was just -- it was just too hard for her, but she did it because wereally pushed her. Mainly my wife pushed her, and so I finally cornered my mother. Isaid, you know, you're the only living person that has met Eva's mother, and you have totalk to her. So they finally went into a room. I don't know what happened, but hopefullyshe told her something. So that's basically, you know, my story.

It took a while because nobody knows where it is. We found it and took a lot ofpictures there with the kids, and then Anita came down, and both her daughter and herson live in London, although they don't speak to each other, so they came in separategroups, and we sat down and we talked, and it was kind of interesting to see the reactionof my grandkids. You know, they were really taken. They really never -- you know, I'vetold them the story, but they never really, you know, got to hear this as firsthand, youknow, knowledge, first hand talking about what happened, and then her daughter camewith her -- her son, and so we had another -- you know, another round of talks, and that The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Well, Ishouldn't say that. I met some of my cousins but the only one of that -- of that generationI met, and, you know, he was a doctor in Bonn, and so I went and had lunch with him andhis wife.

He's married to an ItalianMexican gal, and I don't know -- they -- I don't think they do anything. His -- her side ofthe family did nothing, and my -- my son did nothing.

Now that he is divorced and he is -- he has had major health problems -- he had a bypass operation -- now he is coming back. He has joined a temple and he is on the choir and he is starting to come back. He came up to Rosh Hashanah for services with us, so he is coming back after th fold. My granddaughter today as a matter of fact is going to Israel on the Birthright trip. She is leaving from New York probably right about now, so I'm curious -- very curious to see what the effect will be when she comes back. I know that -- she was also in London with me. They were very taken by the Holocaust Museum in London, and then when they heard the story, you know, that -- that really affected them. They were -- the other kid that was there, Mikey, my middle grandson, you know, he is a real goff-off, and he was -- he was all ears, and he was really attentive, and he told me, he says if you don't publish your book I will, so he was -- I know -- I know he took it very seriously, and it finally -- I think it finally sunk in. The 12-old-year old -- it was interesting. In Santa Barbara there is -- they did an exhibition. It's a room that the Jewish Federation did. I guess they copied Toronto. Toronto has a wall of Holocaust survivors, not particularly KTA but just Holocaust survivors, where they have big plaques. They're probably about, oh, a foot and-a-half wide and about three or four foot tall, three foot tall, where they have the pictures and the stories of the -- of the survivors, and Santa Barbara copied that, and I'm one on the wall, and so we do -- we do -- we do speak to groups.

Of course my daughter told the teacher about it so I was invited to speak, and I spoke, and they had one -- they had about -- about 25 kids in the classroom. One -- one was a problem. You know, he had attention deficit, but the rest of them were just amazingly attentive, and to be honest with you, I got the best questions from those kids that I ever got on any speech.Most of the time we talked to, you know, high schoolers, and it's not cool to ask questions so they don't ask a lot of questions, but I don't know -- since then Joshua has probably not even thought about it.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Looking back at -- at your life in England and the early years of your life, do you think that this Kindertransport and Holocaust experience was decisive in your life, like did it affect certain decisions?","A: I don't think so. I don't think so because I was so young. You know, I talked to some of the fellow, you know, Kindertransporters, and it's kind of the same story. The younger ones, we did okay. Of course my mother took the extra effort to place with me with a family and some of them just went over. You know, some of them went with siblings and they were separated. Some of them went to -- into farms where they were put to work, and so, you know, some of them had a harder life than I had. I was so young.

I just -- I can't visualize giving my one child, you know, at three years old, givingthem away and not knowing whether you'll ever see them again. You know, how hard isthat? Just -- you know, it was just unbelievable what they went through, but for me itwas -- you know, I just don't have a memory of anything.

Q: Do you remember when you just came to Bolivia what your parents were speaking,"A: The only thing -- the only thing I remember really is when we -- I don't rememberanything when we first got there. They probably wouldn't have talked in front of me. I'msure of that, and -- well, then I started learning German so I could understand it. Iremember very distinctly the day the war was over in Europe, there was a -- kind of like abachelor's quarters for the people that worked for the mining -- you know, there was anAmerican mining company. They had a big party, and the only time I saw my motherdrunk. She got tipsy. That's the only time, and the first comment she made is, I'm going togo see what happened to -- you know, to her father and her sister and contact the RedCross right away.
