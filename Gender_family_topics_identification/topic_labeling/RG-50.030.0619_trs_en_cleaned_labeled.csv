"Q: Yeah, yes, yeah, packed in.","A: Allright. We finally -- we tried to get up there and see, look where we were. We knew we were going on the side lines of Warsaw. We knew we were going somewhere to the east from Nowy Dwor, but we certainly didn't know that we were going south.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah.",A: Okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: When we were -- I think somebody yelled out he saw some kind of an eradam (?indecipherable?) I think they saw.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,"A: But it was a guy who looked like, you know -- I says I will never forget the boots for heaven's sake. I heard somebody say in German -- and I understand German. I learned German, (?a lieb en achsen sin lager.?) I didn't understand what the hell that meant. And they start separating the men. There were still lots of women and lots of children. There must have been about 1,500 people. That was the last transport from Nowy Dwor. Men get over to the right. Yeah, the women over to the left going on trucks. Women, children, young kids. I almost went over to them. You know, I figured well, what the hell.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: Allright.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: But I learned my lesson in don't expect any good things from the Germans. So if you can walk, fine, and particularly, I moved myself over to the side of the men, lined up in fives, and this guy, about three rows of fives, an SS man leads us in. They go away immediately, the men -- not the full, whatever went in. I found out of course from my Interview with David Wisnia 40 book, out of the 1,500 who came in, 570, which was a high number, because there were mostly men, you follow me, younger --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Younger feet.,"A: That was the last transport, on their feet, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: -- went into the camp --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And that was --,A: -- selected there and the rest of them went on trucks.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Trucks.,"A: Now, we don't know from nothing. As a matter of fact, what's his name, Zlotnick (ph), my buddy, his sister was about two years older than him, a gorgeous tall girl, although, they didn't take any women from that transport.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Okay. They ride off into a little forest over there. That was a little white house.Some of the guys who came in with their wives, with their families, you know, wanted to find out after we got in, where are the women? Where are the children? So the prisoners started to laugh at them. So you see that big fire out there, outside of the perimeter of the camp? They're dead. There's the machine gun them to the best of my knowledge, first.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: And then burn them in pyres of wood with whatever they did, and I think after about two or three months, the crematoriums were finished. We were building -- we were helping to build the crematoriums. Interview with David Wisnia 41","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep. So were you processed in -- in --,A: I was processed in Birkenau.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep,A: Immediately.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,"A: We received the -- what do you call it, clothing, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Whatever you could get.,"A: You were a big guy, you get short clothes. You're a short guy, you get big -- like in the Army.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Big shoes, small shoes.",A: Okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: So with wooden clogs. That was the worst, those heavy wooden -- I don't know if you've ever seen them --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, I have.",A: They call them the Holland --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: No socks.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: In winter.,"A: Oh, used to rub on here, terrible, terrible. You could hear -- you could hear you coming from ten miles away.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: You know, clank. So anyway, we're assigned to cell block 15, must have been about 450. The rest of them I think went to a different -- I don't know where -- or maybe the whole 570, I don't know, went into that particular -- in cell block the altestewayouzef (ph) This was the Polish --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: The Polish -- Interview with David Wisnia 43,"A: He gave us a talk when we got in there and each one got -- we got four men sleeping in one of those, either four or five. I don't know, some of them were five. I always managed to get one on top --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Good idea.,"A: -- immediately. Sure. I wanted to be on top. So and I was only, I would say about two or three days, I was like every other prisoner, because I was assigned to the job of cleaning, you know, picking up the bodies from the ditch.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes. These are people who had committed suicide?,"A: Committed suicide, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: By electrocuting themselves?,"A: Yes --well, what they did know -- let's say this is the perimeter of the camp, right?","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yep, yep.","A: A trip wire, okay, with just a little trip wire, a ditch, electrified by a wired fence, sentry box. So not that they needed an excuse. Anybody wanted to commit suicide, very easy. You put your foot over that trip wire, which means you're trying to escape. The guy would shoot you from the sentry box. Many of them, that's what the German transport did, about two months later, when they found out what was going on there.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: So that was my job for the first couple of years [sic], to put the bodies together on two, three guys, you know, heap on a wagon, a wooden wagon, bring it over to a particular cell block, line up and then it went to the crematorium where, crematorium -- not the crematorium, the pyre of woods where they did them. Interview with David Wisnia 44","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: The pyre, yep.",A: I only did this for about I think eight or nine days.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,A: Maybe two weeks.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: Not even that. One night after coming from work in the afternoon, the blockalteste: Is there anyone here who sings?(?Indeciperhable?) Sing. You sing. Everybody, hey, Wisnia, get down. Sing. I get down from my booksa (ph). There was a place about the size of this, the middle of the regular tiers of beds, of those wooden booksas (ph), and that was right there. There was a door to a special room for the blockalteste, who was -- he was the boss of life and death really.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: And Isang. From that moment on, my life changed.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What did you sing?,"A: Buy me a (?undeciperhable?). Joseph, Joseph, won't you make your mind up.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: Hebrew, what did I do? He couldn't care less, as long --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Didn't matter what it was?,A: Didn't matter what it was.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: As long as --,A: Isang.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- you entertained him?,A: Isang.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Anything in Polish?,"A: Yeah, sure. (?undeipherable?) Oh , he loved that. That was very popular. I knew every song. This was my life.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.","A: So from that moment on, he says, okay, tomorrow you're not going to that job.You're going to stay right here in the -- it was like a revelation.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you were the stubendienst?,"A: [became a stubendienst. Actually, I couldn't become a stubendienst because the stubendienst had some pull from somebody. So I became the assistant to the stubendienst.You talk about -- what do you call it, protect ya. Oh, God.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah.","A: Then they came to select people for the various commandos, you follow?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: I don't remember how often I went out to work. I didn't go out to work very often, but the greatest privilege was when it came to the roll calls, because remember, it was cold as hell all the time.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And that went for hours?,A: Hours. People used to die standing there.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: So. And they count -- they didn't now how to count. They didn't have a system. If you read -- what's a her name, Tippy's book, you'll see. She's got it tagged right. They had no system.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: They needed the prisoners to help them with the system.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: That's why they have a stubendienst, a kapo, a blockalteste, you follow, and if were you in with these --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You were in?,A: You were in.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: And my job, and I really -- believe me, if I ever prayed always one more day, let me, I've got to -- but I'll tell you something. You know, somebody just asked is me, to what do I attribute my survival at one of my speeches. It took me a long time to figure it out, but I knew the first day when I got undressed in front of the sauna before we went in for the shower, I was standing in front of an SS man who was about 6'6. My eyes fixed in to his belt buckle. You can imagine how tall he was. To me it looked that tall, right? This is in front of the sauna. I'll never forget this as long as I live, and I look in, and what does it say on the belt buckle -- you won't believe this -- I don't know if you ever heard that, Gott mit uns. Okay. God is with us.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Is with us, yes.",A: Swastika here -- Interview with David Wisnia 47,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: -- in the middle and then SS insignia on the side. I swear I looked in there, and for a second I had to hold myself back from laughing. I says you son of a bitch -- I didn't say that. I said not the God I learned about. I'm going to do everything in my life to outlive you.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yep, yep.","A: Lalready saw what was going on there, and from that moment on, you will not believe, I said to myself, 750 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York; 723 Gates Avenue, Brooklyn, New York. Right. I didn't have any pencil. I didn't have anything. I used to be the fancy writer in the house -- in my house. So every time we had -- my mother had two sisters here in the States. One of them who came in the first world war, elder sister, who lived on the concourse in New York, and the other one who left about six months before the war broke out. Her younger sister came to her. She took her down before the war. Her name was Helen Borenstein (ph). That played quite a trick on me because I screwed up the addresses. Wait till you hear this one.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Wait for the purse war thing, but yeah.",A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: In your -- in your --,A: What gave me --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: In your mind.,"A: And I'll tell you something, what gave me, at that moment, I says, it's not what I learned. No, God isn't with them, not the God that I know. I'm going to try to outlive you. I did.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Absolutely.,"A: I did. And you know, I used -- somebody asked me why do I come in with it now. I had -- I told that story before but I delivered a speech about three months ago, four months ago over here at -- where my granddaughter lives. The teachers wanted me to come and tell them about World War II. Okay. I came in and one of the kids -- you want to hear? This is incredible. All assembly of the high school, one of the kids gets up -- and I'm pretty good at geography. So I walked over. I wanted -- I like to show them, how did so many Jews get there, to Poland, and I'm a history buff. So I know the history of the Jewish people.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Okay. And I like a -- what do you call -- a blackboard, and I draw Poland, show them how the Jews got from the -- after the Spanish Inquisition. It's incredible, and I'll tell you, that's better than any history book, and I show them exactly where Auschwitz was, where Warsaw was, where I lived, right, and I tell them after I finish -- I wasn't even finished. One of the kids gets up, I ask -- I love to ask, ""Any questions?"" One kid, sitting there, gets up and says, ""Sir, if there was something what made you really survive all this?"" I says, well, it's not easy to give you an answer, I says, but I prefaced it by telling, ""Look, this is a public school. I'm not going to tell you, but I had a very good religious background."" I said, ""By religious I don't mean Orthodox, but Iontectnetbnancedjusetneey for ther biormatierabouttfisontecionInterview with David Wisnia 49 know -- I know my history,"" I says. And all I learned is something that made me -- the first moment I got in there I told them this story of being -- of looking into this SS man's middle, right, and seeing Gott mit uns. Listen to this, the kid gets up and says, ""You know my grandfather"" -- this could have been -- I tell you, I couldn't have planned it any better. ""My grandfather came here from the Ukraine and he had one of those, and it says Gott mit uns"" -- listen to this -- ""one of those belt buckles. We erased the swastika and the SS, but Gott mit uns is still on there."" I almost flipped out.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What did you say?,A: I didn't know. I didn't know -- I didn't say a word because I was afraid. I was really hesitant. I says --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: -- what happens if his grandfather was an SS man?,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.","A: How did he get -- how did he get this belt buckle? Did he get it from -- I'll tell you, the people there, I couldn't have said anything better in my whole speech, because it lent credence to what I told.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: That's amazing. Actually, that's an amazing --",A: This just happened about two months ago.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,"A: And he said, ""I'm not going to do it anymore."" He started to throw up, and he said, ""I'm going to probably not be here. They're going to send me to the Russian front.""

"Q: Sure, sure.","A: So I know when this happened. There was one chamber that was a dry chamber in that sauna, okay, in the old sauna building. Okay. There was a place where we used to gas the clothes, a place for showers, because the prisoners used to come in about once a month or whatever, you know, for lousing.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yes, delousing.",A: You know.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: Delousing or whatever.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Right. Delousing, right. I should get it right, because lousing is different. Okay. Sundays -- it was a Sunday. It was very warm in that chamber, and the guys who worked there, there were about three or four other fellas, okay, went in after the morning roll call. We had a morning roll call, the apel, which was less than a few minutes, and the 1:00 o'clock was the big apel. Wisnia goes to sleep there, and I wake up. It got so quiet. It must have been about 10 after 1:00 and there's nobody in there. I look out the window of the sauna and I can see (?indecipherable?) the general, with his desk, in the middle of the road of Birkenau. The whole camp is standing at attention so to speak.

Q: The number.,"A: They had to get the number. They knew what cell block, because we stayed all on the outside lined up. There was somebody missing from that cell block. I woke myself up, and I see everybody, and I started to run from the sauna, from here all the way through the barracks, the side of the barracks down to cell block 15, which is on the left, and I tried to hide in between the people, but they wouldn't let me, because they already found out there was somebody missing there. You can imagine.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",A: You talk about luck.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: The SS man who is doing the count comes over to cell block, blockalteste tells him that, you know, this is the fella's here.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: He's arrived?,"A: Brings me up to the center road. There's the desk with the general taking the count, right, from all the cell blocks. You realize, there must have been 50,000, 40,000 prisoners.

Q: The sauna.,"A: And he winks to me. I'm standing next to the ditch, it was sort of like water, with his gun in one hand and with his hook, like a meat hook, and he goes over to me, and says, ""You make one move and you're dead,"" and there's the general standing right there. He's saying it for his benefit. He's winking to me. Okay. I didn't move. All right. I knew I was in trouble. I immediate -- I knew that was the end. I got sick after that, right, a couple of -- I had a regular trial in the schreibsteube, you know, where they do the records and I was sent in for three -- to three months in the strafkommando.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Which is hard labor?,"A: Which is -- it's like -- I'll tell you, it's a -- they would have killed -- if it was anybody else, they would have killed them immediately.

I think I stayed for only about six weeks or seven weeks. I had to go out to work and that wasn't fun, you know, being in the strafkommando.

Q: No.,"A: But you know, it was mostly popular stuff.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Sure, sure.",A: So.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Sure.,"A: But it is singing that saved, there's no question about it. It was -- it singled me out as different from anybody else, and I was. Consequently, of course, I got more food. I got different food. I got access to everything I wanted.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: Asa matter of fact, when I used to meet Tippy in one of the blocks that was lined up with clothing and there was a special place, a hiding place about a story high where there was clothing. We used to get in there through the side so.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,A: It would have had to be -- we were closer to the Russian side of course.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,A: Near the Ukraine.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Going in that direction. We're beginning to hear, and we figured survive another week, another month. You know, that was the whole point, try to survive. Eventually, we knew, and George told us they're going to lose the war. He knew it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: He knew it. As a matter of fact, he used to tell us, the Russian front is -- it's about 50 or 60 miles away, and they were scared to death of the Russians. Well, because of what they did to the Russians, you can imagine.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.",A: It's no surprise. So that was the greatest fear among the SS is that they were going to be sent to the Russian front.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: Because they knew that had they done that, anything out of the __, that was the end.So are you all right?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah. I'm just checking.,"A: So at one of the liaisons with Tippy, she -- we agreed and we made up our mind if we're going to survive, at the end of the war, let us meet in front of the Jewish Community Center in Warsaw, (?undecipherable?) and I figured -- I don't know why I figured it was going to be there. I figured let's meet over there. Okay. I go on the transport, on the death march.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: To Gleiwitz?,"A: To Gleiwitz, on --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: This is what -- Interview with David Wisnia 64,A: On one of -- this is in December of 1944.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: 1944. Yep.,"A: They stopped gassing -- I remember the uprising, because the sauna was right next door to the crematorium. I remember the boys running around and the machine guns were set up, and they locked up our areas so that they shouldn't come into our -- we knew what was going on.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: So the windup was that after they finished that, they actually stopped the gassings.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: What do you call it, this was after the large transports, after the Hungarian --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: After the (?indeciperhable?) transports.,"A: The whole -- I remember (?indeciperhable?) bit when they took them -- they were supposed to go to the train station but they went to crematorium five. Oh, it was -- I knew the whole story of what was going because I was privy. I wasn't a (?indeciperhable?) you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.",A: So I knew what was going on.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: The windup was that we -- on the march, the march was not good. I escaped from the march. That was my first attempt to escape, but they rounded us up and again they didn't shoot us, because we are strafed, you know, and then when we tried to walk --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: By Russian bombers? Interview with David Wisnia 65,"A: By the Russian planes, and wait, you're talking about something playing a trick on me, the Russian planes we saw stars, red stars, right? Who cared, red stars, green stars, as long as it wasn't the swastika, right? They attached themselves, and believe me, there was something for us to see, some of the Germans, wounded, no arms, no legs. They used to attach themselves with trucks, tanks, follow the column. Remember, you're talking about thousands of people marching. Not too far, that wasn't near Gleiwitz. That was in a different place. Yeah, we stay over in Gleiwitz in the train depot. Then they put us on a train -- open train to Dachau.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,A: Okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yep.,"A: Okay. From the open train, I escaped with about 12 other guys. We made our way, I don't even know where, but we saw there was chaos. There was a, what do you call it, a strafing or bombing. We didn't know who, by whom. Anyway, an SS men starts searching and he winds -- winds us -- rounds us all up, brings us back to the train and we get back on the train. Why he didn't kill us, I don't know. Okay. We go to Dachau. We arrive in Dachau. No point in going into details. Open cars, freezing. God almighty.January. February, probably. You can imagine in Germany. Okay. We wind up -- I come into Dachau. If you ever saw when I came into Auschwitz, no comparison. This was ten times worse.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yes.,"A: Why? No place to sit. No place to stand. No place to sleep. No place to eat. Interview with David Wisnia 66 Typhoid rampant. From all over, you know --","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah.,"A: And I knew already then, if you could only again survive a little bit, you know, you might make it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,A: I talked to myself.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, yeah.","A: So the windup, I hang around the schreibestube of, what do you call it, Dachau, around there, the closest barracks on the side. I don't know how long we were in Dachau.But in Dachau itself, I saw -- this was worse than Auschwitz, for me it was worse. I couldn't. One day I see a sign up there, must have been about a couple of days or something like. Anybody who can carry a -- is it 50 or 75-pound -- not pound, kilo of something, of cement, report. We need to work -- they were -- they wanted to work on the underground hangars for the airplanes. It is now -- must be February. Okay.Everybody's strong enough. I'm strong enough. I want to get out of here, because I'm not going to be able to survive here. I don't know anybody. No longer privileged prisoner.You can imagine.","[1, 2, 3]"
