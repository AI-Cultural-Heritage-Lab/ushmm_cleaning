I went out and for every event I was the highest of them all. In the cohouse(ph), in there, the head of the cohouse(ph) didn't know how to write. Whoever came there, they came to me and I had to give hima thing. So there in the woods I was also one of the bestcutters there and Iwas respected. So that what it was. Why?Because He help me. I'll tell you something, when God _ -- I don't know, but always I did believe in God. Especially when they say it was one God, one God. So Ido believe this God, He did create the world and He did create our world. He did create us. Now you will ask me, ""How did he create us?"" I'll tell you how. Did you ever hear of Abraham and Sarah?Sarah, when she was young, she couldn't have any children. She was crying and begging. But when she was 90-years old, when she could not have children, then God gave herthat she had one son, Yitzchok. So Yitzchok was the creation. Because by 90 years she couldn't have it.

God stopped him and said, ""No, I don't want him to be killed."" He didn'tsay, ""Don't touch your son,"" but ""Don't touch this boy."" Why? Because as a sonyou gave him to me, so he's my son and to you he's just a boy.Do youunderstand? So what did God do? He gave him -- he gave him a animal, a kosheranimal. There -- this animal couldn't walk any farther because _ stopped it. And hetook Avram and killed the animal. He gave it to God instead Yitzchok, andYitzchok was already God's son. This way we are children of Yitzchok, and thisis our God. That'swhy I believe in God. You understand what I'm talking about?Now, we had Arvam, Yitzchok and Jacob. They are our forefathers. And wehave foremothers, and they did have their children and this way God did createour nation. Now, if you'll ask me why did God need us? You know how? Becausedid you ever hear of Noah?

And that's what did happen.So seems tobe that the Jews did not behave right to God and that's why he did punish uswith that thing. It was a punishment. And then he says: After this punishmentI'll remember you will (?lend?) Israel.""I'll remember."" Not ""I'll give you backthe whole of Israel,"" but a part of it. And that's what he did.

What do that mean? You can seemy background, what I did, and then you can see me in your imagination. Thatmeans don't believe in nobody's face.
