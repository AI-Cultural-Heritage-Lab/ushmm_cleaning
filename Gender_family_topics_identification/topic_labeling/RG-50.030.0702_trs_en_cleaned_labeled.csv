Q: Were there more Jews who were brought to this place?,"A: There were other Jews and some people who maybe were alleged to be Communists or politically undesirable, and but Mussolini paid us a stipend, and so we were able to exist, and he did not go along with Hitler's extermination plan, you know.

Q: Do you think he did?Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 16,"A: Yes, he did in his way by isolating us. And then my mother wrote a letter petitioning, you know, that we wanted to be reunited with my dad, and about a year later, he came to Atessa.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Hang on a second. Before we come to that, you mentioned that all his rights were taken away. Did you feel that? You were a child at the time, but did you feel what that meant?","A: Well, I knew that I couldn't go to school like other children did.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay. Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 17,"A: And my parents made every effort to get us tutors, you know, because there was some English people that were also interned because they got caught up being in Italy, and so, you know, my parents made every sacrifice to, you know, have us become literate, and which we did, but we never went to any formal school. And also they had to sacrifice and sell things in order to, you know, pay for tutors and our education.","[1, 2, 3]"

We kind of got by.And then they sent us, because we were so dangerous, they sent us to another town after about two years, I think.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What was the official reason?,"A: Well, they never gave it to us, you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. Do they just come and announce it?,"A: They just said, you know, you have to now go to the Abbruzzi, which is like a mountainous region of Italy, and we went to a town called Atessa.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 18","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And what was that like?,"A: Well, you know, we found nice lodgings in this tiny little villa out of the way, small little rooms. I remember that. It had a garden outside.

"Q: Oh, I see.",A: I think.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Of the Allied Forces?,"A: Yes, the Italians, and so then the Germans felt free to invade Italy, and that's when things really became bad for us.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What happened?,"A: Well, then we had to hide and run because they were hunting Jews, and even though the Italians, you know, were very good, they didn't turn you in because there was very little anti-Semitism in Italy. There weren't that many Jews to hate. And so then thingsInterview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 19 became, you know, quite hectic for us. We had to run and hide, and then the bombing started, so we had to protect ourselves from that.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How did you -- excuse me. How did you hide? Would you leave?,"A: We would run, you know, when we would hear, somebody would tell us that the Germans were looking, we would run into the countryside and look for farmers, and I think some of them my parents must have bribed, you know, and they let us sleep in their stalls and whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And then you would return back to --,"A: Then when we heard that they left, and once they caught us, the Germans.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Tell me the circumstances of how you were caught.,"A: Well, we were running, and, you know, they had dogs, and they had guns, and they caught us. And my brother and I, we started crying, you know, ""Please don't take my daddy,"" and ""please,"" you know, we cried, and somehow, you know -- oh, there was a German woman also interned because she was married to a Jew from Hamburg.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So they caught you and they took you to --,"A: We were running, you know, with this other couple. They were staying in a neighboring farm, and so she started speaking to the -- she was a glamorous-looking blonde -- to this captain, lieutenant, whatever he was, and somehow by a miracle of miracles, they let us go back, you know, to hiding, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: In other words, they never brought you to a prison? You were caught on the road?Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 20","A: Yeah, we were caught running in a countryside.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Okay.,"A: And that the next day, he came with some provisions.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: Yes. So I guess there were some humane, you know, Germans, also.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Was he alone when you were caught, or were there lots of soldiers?","A: No, he had a lot of soldiers, but he was in command, so, you know, I don't know what he told them.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Because that's unusual. That would sound unusual.,A: [know. We always talk about how lucky we were that --,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And she said something in German to him, do you think?","A: Well, my parents spoke German, too, you know, so they spoke to him, and he had pity on us, and he just let us all go.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But frightening for children.,"A: Oh, I never forgot that, how it was, you know, muddy, and how we lost our shoes running, and also the Germans had set mines all over the place, so it was very dangerous where you were going because one day while we were running, one of the people running in back of us just got killed from a mine.Interview with Eugenia WER abournns coteeton 21","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Stepped on it and blown to bits?,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Anybody, but a child at age ten, eleven, and your brother even younger; do you think that that affected you?","A: Well, you know, always people tell me that I'm emotionally, you know, a strong person. It kind of hardens you in a way. In a way, we were like wise beyond our years because my parents would tell us to go and listen to what some of the Germans were saying, you know, because --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You could speak German?,"A: Because we understood what they were saying, so I know we did that when we were quite young.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: I see.,"A: I mean one thing about him, he didn't let the Jews be sent to concentration camps, and he protected his Jews as long as he was alive. I mean even though we lost all ourInterview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 22 freedoms and everything, but that was a compromise, I guess, that we had to live by and in a way be grateful because we are here, and, you know, we did survive, and then there was a whole conflict in that area.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mm-hmm.,"A: Because the Germans were there, and the Allies were coming in, and there was like --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So there were battles?,"A: Oh, terrible battles. We saw people getting killed right out near, looking out the window. There was actual war right where we were.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But give me the name again.,A: Atessa.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Atessa. And again, war comes upon you, and you're children?","A: Yes. Well, they mined everything. They destroyed all the bridges, you know, so that the Allies couldn't come in easily. And at this point I developed a very high fever, temperature, while we were running. And we were staying in this farm house, so they had a hospital there, so my parents took me to the hospital, and they let us stay in the hospital, and they had cannons on top of the hospital, even though they had a big Red Cross on top of it, and we could hear the bombs coming and going, you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So this was the Italians who had those cannons, or whose cannons?","A: No, the Germans.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And you were in a hospital where there were German cannons?,"A: Underneath. And, you know, they gave us shelter, and at that point they weren't looking for us because they were just fighting and retreating. Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 23","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So my question is this. Two questions. Did you ever feel under -- insecure around Italians that you might be betrayed?,"A: No, no, never. They were very brave, or maybe they didn't understand the consequences of their deeds. I don't know which it was. But wherever we went, somebody, you know, would give us succor, you know, would give us protection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And did you look -- I mean, again, would it be easy to recognize you?","A: No, because, you know, we were running, and my parents negotiated, and we just hid in this stall. Every now and then they were kind enough and invite us to a meal, but, you know, most of the time, we just subsisted on whatever we could find. So, you know, my brother and I said, you know, maybe if we knew who they were, we might go looking for them, you know, but it was so transient because we didn't stay in any place for that long because it was dangerous.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Were you limited by a certain area, though, I mean that you moved from place to place, but never very far from where you were before?","A: Well, we stayed in the countryside because we thought we were safer there, and also maybe safer from the bombing and from all the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Where were some of the larger towns so that I'd get a geographical sense?,"A: Atessa. I really don't know, you know. It's in the Abbruzzi.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And while you were in the hospital, and there were the cannons up top, what happened? Did they fire from there?","A: They fired from right up our roofs, and they would fire back, and that whole part of that hospital was demolished.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 24","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So it was not safe at all?,"A: It wasn't safe. So then we ran. Someone told us to run to this hotel in town, and practically the whole building fell on us, but, you know, we went to a basement, whatever, and, you know, we survived.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You hid in the basement?,A: We were just lucky.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How long did this go on for?,"A: Seemed like forever, but I guess it wasn't that long, but then, you know, the Allies came in, and they liberated us.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Do you remember what they looked like when you saw them?,"A: They were British. They were British troops that liberated that part of Italy, mostly Indians.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, really?","A: Yeah. The Indians, you know, fought for the British, and they found us a place to stay, an apartment that, you know, if it was empty, they just took it temporarily, and one of the Indian officers lived with us, and then all of a sudden things started looking up because we had food, and we had protection, and we --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And this was 1944?,"A: The end of ""44.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay. So --,"A: And then in -- and then we went -- we stayed there for a few months, and then we were sent to a DP camp.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 25","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And where was the DP camp?,"A: The first one was Palazze, which is near Naples, but they were old Army barracks.They were not equipped for winter living. So it was really pretty there because it was near the Mediterranean, and we had a very nice summer, and then when fall came, they sent us to Barletta.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Where is that?,"A: No, well, first when we were liberated -- I'm sorry -- we went to Palazze. Then they sent us to Santa Maria de Bagno, it was called, in the Apulia section. And then they had confiscated all these villas of rich Italians who were, you know, using them for the summer, and they put all the displaced people in these villas.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Were there many displaced people?,"A: Oh, yeah. Then all the people started coming from Poland, from Auschwitz, and that's when I learned Yiddish.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, I see.",A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So is that also when you learned, your parents learned, at least, what had happened in Poland?","A: No, they had heard rumors.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,A: While the war was still going on.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That must have been so heartbreaking. Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 26,"A: Somebody came to our house one day, I remember that, and told my mother, and then she was hysterical, crying, and somehow, you know, we found out what it was all about, that she was told that her whole family was, you know, was killed.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Which house would this have been? Where would this have been?,"A: That was before, that was before the Mussolini.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was murdered?,A: Was murdered.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So that would have been when you were in one of the villages?,"A: Yes, we were in Tuscania.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: You were in Tuscania.,"A:So rumors, you know, traveled. People got mail or whatever. I don't know how this man found out. And as a matter of fact, when my sisters were born after the war, and then in the Jewish religion, you are not allowed to name after the living, so my parents named -- they gave them both Biblical names because they weren't absolutely sure who had survived and who didn't because this was all hearsay.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Well, tell me this, something I meant to ask and forgot momentarily. Were your parents very religious?","A: Well, they were -- came from a very religious background, but when we lived in Italy, my dad tried to maintain all the Jewish traditions, you know, Passover, and mainly I remember Passover, where he made his own matzo because we couldn't get that, but there was no such thing as having kosher food or, you know, anything like that, but we Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg infomation abouts cotseten 27 maintained, you know, at home. So then we were in the DP camps, several different DP camps. Let me see. One, two -- about four of them for five years.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Why?,"A: Well, because you needed -- you know, to have a visa to come here.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So you didn't want to stay in Italy, your parents?","A: Well, we couldn't go back to Abbazia because it wasn't Italy anymore. It was Communist Tito.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And your father didn't --,"A: And we didn't want to go back to more oppressions, and we didn't know -- things were not the same.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: So my parents debated whether to go to Israel or -- and then he opted, he said, you know, after what we went through, he wanted us to come to a safe place.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So --,A: So we waited.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you were in these various DP camps for five years?,"A: Yeah, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did you go to school?,"A: Well, after the war.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: We took -- my parents hired again tutors to prepare us to pass an entrance exam, because in Italy, you know, you have to pass entrance exams, each level of schooling thatInterview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 28 you go through, and we made it, and then we started middle school, and then from then on we went to Genoseo {ph}, and then {undecipherable} for one year, so I had -- which is like almost a year of college.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: When you were in the DP camps, did it feel like internment, or did it feel like just temporary housing?","A: Yeah, temporary housing, in barracks. We had one room for six people.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Who was there?,A: Communal. My two sisters.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, they were born.","A: My brother and my parents. And we had communal showers and bathrooms, and very primitive. They had mess hall, you know, for people. We were fed that way. And the school was very far away, so in one town, my father hired a man with a donkey, and he would pick us up every morning and take us to school --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: A chauffeur.,"A: -- you know, and then pick us up because he started working, and they had like a K.P.thing in the camp itself, and he was running it.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Well, that's what my next question is. How did your father earn any money that he would be able to --","A: Well, they gave us, you know, provisions, cans of food, and we had lodging, and then when he started, you know, working in this K.P., he started earning some money, and they, my parents, sacrificed a lot for our education, hiring math professors, because, youInterview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 29 know, we really didn't know anything about math, and but somehow we did well even without --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Formal schooling?,A: -- without having any elementary education.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's pretty amazing.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's pretty amazing. Were they -- had their personalities been affected?,A: My parents?,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, by everything that they had gone through.","A: Yeah, my dad was, you know, quite nervous. I'm sure it affected them deeply, but they didn't really -- you know, my father was a very positive-thinking man. He was always grateful, you know, that we survived and that we were healthy and that, you know, things, when we came here, even though they struggled, you know, my dad could never earn much money, and he had to go and learn how to be an operator.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What kind?,"A: Clothing, you know, sewing, because he couldn't find -- he didn't speak the language.He spoke a little English.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So was he a tailor here?,"A: Not a real tailor. I think they did piecework, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's tough.,"A: It was very tough for them, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did both of them do this?Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 30,"A: Well, then my mother, because she had twolittle children --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Of course.,A: -- and so she couldn't really go to work. And then we came here to join finally an uncle in Hoboken. My father promised him that he would never ask him for anything if he --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Sponsored you?,"A: -- if he brought us over here, and we never did. And we came in 1950 to the United States. And we stayed for seven weeks in a hotel. The Joint {ph} put us up there, and then we went to the {undecipherable}, which is where theShakespeare Theater is now.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I don't know where that is in New York.,A: It's on Broadway.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, okay.",A: In the village.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, okay.","A: And then they found us an apartment in the Bronx, a five-floor walk-up.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how big was it?,"A: It had enough rooms, but the Bronx was turning, and it wasn't such a safe place anymore. So my parents sent my sisters to a Yeshiva, a Hebrew school, and my brother and I, he was 16 and I was 18, so we went to work, and so we managed.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's tough.,"A: Yeah, it was very tough.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 31","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: All that displacement.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: All that displacement. So actually you kind of lost home?,A: Many times.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Many times. Did you ever have a feeling of home?,"A: Well, home was where my parents were, you know, and we had a very strong family bond. So because of my parents, somehow, you know, knowing that we were together and we were with them, that gave you a sense of safety, but we were always, you know -- everything was unpredictable. We never knew what would be tomorrow.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: But the one thing that was stable was the family?,A: Was the family.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's pretty big.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: Well, family is very important.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How did your life progress here in the states?,"A: Well, I married in 1952.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So pretty soon?,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: And first I went to work in a factory. Then I progressed to a clerical job. And then when my daughter was born quite soon after, and so I had three children.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 32","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,A: And I stayed home.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: When were your children born?,"A: Well, Debbie was born in ""53, and then a son was born in ""57.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: My condolences.,"A: And I have another son, Richard, who is going to be 50. He's not 50 yet.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So he was born in the ""60s?","A: Yeah. And as soon as they were a little older, I went to college.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, what college did you go to?",A: Brooklyn College.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: And I did well in school, and then I got a master's in school psychology.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I wanted to ask you about that.,"A: Yeah, and I worked for 27 years as a school psychologist, and I am now retired.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Well, tell me, why did -- how -- or how was psychology something that drew you?","A: Oh, I don't know. When I graduated college, I started teaching, and I thought that that's what I really wanted to do, to teach, but New York City at that time, you know, it was not ideal to teach, especially not middle school. I made a mistake. If I had gone into elementary school, probably it would have been better for me because in my nature, it wasn't in me to be a police person.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 33","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And middle school you kind of have to?,A: Thirty percent of the time having to discipline kids.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: So I realized very quickly that that wasn't what I wanted to be, and so I said I'll try and find something within the school system that gets me out of the classroom, and so -- and I made the right choice because that was, you know, the right decision for me.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did psychology intrigue you?,A: I don't know if it was so much that I was intrigued. I just knew that it would be a good job for me.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: Because I like people, and I'm very, you know, sympathetic to other people's plights, so and it worked out well.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: What is it that your parents -- in the things that we inherit, we can inherit things, but we can also inherit things that are not tangible. What are the intangibles that your parents kind of bequeathed to you?","A: My parents, you know, I have four siblings, and we all, despite everything that we went through, we all turned out to be resilient, and humanitarian, and upstanding citizens with very good moral values, you know, so whatever my parents did, they did something that just worked, you know, and we all turned out to be pretty successful in our own pursuits. Everyone in my family is a professional, you know, and so my parents made the right choice coming to this country.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Tell me how their lives progressed after they came here.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 34,"A: Well, when the Bronx turned so badly, my brother helped them buy a house in Brighton.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: He put down the down payment, whatever.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Brighton Beach?,"A: Yes. Brighton, First Street. It was a two-family house because they had two, you know, they had two young children, and they didn't want to have to deal with the changes that were happening, and they were very happy with this little house. You know, they rented the upstairs, and even though my father didn't make very much, but with the rent, and they lived frugally, and they didn't have any excesses, you know, they somehow managed to have a very nice life here.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Were they happy people?,"A: Yeah, my dad was a very happy person. He was very gregarious. He liked to tell jokes. He loved people. He became very religious, though, and he went to a synagogue regularly. And he died in 1978.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And your mom?,A: My mom died in 1986. She was 93.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did they ever talk to your children about--,"A: No, not really. My kids interviewed her, you know, for school, different things like that, but nothing, nothing formal. Interview with Eugenia Weiss Greenberg. 35","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And did you, amongst yourselves, the -- all the children and your parents, without your children involved, did you talk about these things?","A: Yeah, my brother and I did, and especially we went back together a few years ago, ten years ago. We spent a month in Florence. We had an apartment, and we rented a car, and we went back to both Tuscania and Atessa. And it's really strange, you know, that what you remember and what is is not always the same.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So how did that show up?,"A: We went there. We found the places that we lived in. We remembered it, you know, between the two of us, we located the places, and, you know, where I had remembered a huge park, it was a tiny little nothing. -- The villa that we lived in in Atessa, you know, was --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Not so big?,"A: Well, it wasn't big. I don't remember it being big, but we scouted around, and we went to places that we remembered. So that was very nice. Now no one knew, remembered anything.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay. Okay. Do you think there were any -- it's so transient, so it's almost like in the areas where you were during those years, there were probably no footprints left of what happened, or are there?","A: Well, I'm sure that some people do know, but maybe, you know, because we were just there for two days, we couldn't really do any investigative reporting, you know, and see, but we went by where we had to go and give our number every day, and we went to, you know, different sites that we remember, so we did do that.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma sbourans eoteewen 36","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I remember we were looking at a photograph of maybe it was the same trip or another trip when you were there with your daughter?,"A: No, no, that was -- you know, that's the -- that's a different part of Italy.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: That's where you were originally from, right?",A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Where your daughter and --,"A: No, that's Apulia {ph}. That's not --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did you ever go back to Abbazia?,"A: Yes, I went back a few years ago, and that was also a big, you know, blow to my memory, but I did find Villa Jaime where I was born, and I did find the park, and the places we went swimming, and Principe Umberto, which I remember as being this huge hotel was broken up into different parts. But the general atmosphere, the palm trees, and the beauty of the little place, you know, remains.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Doesn't mean your memory was wrong; it just means life changed?,"A: Yeah, it just was distorted, and even though it's Croatia, you know, people still speak Italian there. Many stores still have Italian headings, and so the -- you know, the Croatian government now is making it -- you know, is resuscitating the allure of the place.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did your grandchildren express interest in what had gone on with you?,"A: Not that much really. You know, they ask questions every now and then, but they never, you know, never explored. But my brother has some tapes, but, you know, he is not here anymore, and he lives in Pennsylvania.Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 37","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: He lived in Pennsylvania?,A: He interviewed my mom before she died.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: Yeah, I think. I don't know if-- what happened to the tapes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Because those could be very interesting to have at the museum.,"A: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to ask my sister-in-law if she has them, or if she knows where they are.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: That could be quite -- that would be very, very important, you know. We would value that.","A: I don't know what, you know, the interview is all about, but when I speak to her next, I will ask her if she remembers.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And for yourself, those formative years, when -- when you had such an insecure life and sometimes a life that could have been easily taken away, how do you think that that's -- what does it play -- when you think of your life in total, how big is that portion of it?","A: Well, it's at the core of me, you know. I think it made me who I am. It made me strong and flexible, and it's something I'll never forget. It's a history that, you know, that will be with me forever, even though it's kind of not always there, you know, on the outside.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I think your daughter mentioned to me when she got in touch with us that you had never given your story before. You had never told --Interview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma Stour colseten 38,"A: No, I mean they know bits and pieces, you know, but it's not something that my parents dwelled on, and I think that that's some kind of a pattern of people who have gone through a lot, that they don't really talk about it.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So were you reluctant to do so?,"A: Well, you know, I mean once I realized the importance of it, you know, but it's not something that is spontaneous.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Got that. I've got that. Is there something -- excuse me for a second. Is there something that I haven't asked about that we haven't discussed that you think is pertinent to all, to our subject today?","A: Well, you know, I had asked my daughter, because she has all the names of the people that -- my uncles and aunts that, that didn't survive, and so many cousins, and that, you know, that I think my brother, when he went to Yad Vashem in Israel, I think inscribed their names. I'm not so positive. But she was at work when I called her this morning, and she didn't have it with her.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So you would want to have those names?,"A: Yes, I would like to add them to, you know, the victims"" list if they are not there yet, you know. I don't know if the museum has them or not.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I don't know, but when she finds the names, and if they are sent to me, I will forward that to the people who handle those, those data bases, and see that.","A: But I do want to say that of all the people in Europe, the Italians were probably the most noble and life savers than any other nation. The people, not so much the institutions, like the church, but the people. They did not turn anybody in. Maybe there were a fewInterview with Eugenia Was WIEBE oma sbourans eoteewen 39 cases that I don't know of that I'm sure, but they were the most civil of, you know, of all the people.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You have touched on a subject that I think sometimes is very, very important and one of the losses that so many people had who had different experiences, that very often part of the experience a person went through, if they were in Auschwitz or if they were ina concentration camp or they were in an area further north, is that neighbors that they knew",A: Turned them in.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- betrayed them.,A: Not the Italians.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And so consequently, people lost faith in humanity.",A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That wasn't part of what your experience was then?,"A: Well, [used to somehow wonder, you know, why so many innocent people had to die for what, you know, but I still have faith, and as the Italians, you know, proved, there is, you know, hope for humanity yet.","[1, 2, 3]"
