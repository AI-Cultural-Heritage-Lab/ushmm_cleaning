Q: Wow.,"A: And I know that -- I assume my parents had talked about leaving before that because then he came home and he told my mother, see, we have friends, we don't have to worry; and my mother said no, and we left either the next day or very soon thereafter.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,A: And we had passports and we left by an airplane in 1938.,"[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: That's great. So before we get to that, because that's the big piece of the story --","A: Yeah, I know. That's a lot later, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So you just mentioned, though, that after the Anschluss you remember being impressed with the Hitler Jugand marching?",A: Yeah. I believe they had flags and they were marching and sounded like it should be fun to an eight-year old.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Not in the context that we know it now of course.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: What about adult Nazis, adult officers and officials do you recall?","A: I don't remember -- I remember after the Anschluss my father would go and whenever he visited his patients at their home, the owner of the garage would take him and would drive him instead of having my father drive, and once he took me along. I remember while I was waiting downstairs while he went to see somebody and I saw the sign owned by Arians and I asked, what does that mean, and the guy shushed me up and told me not to ask those questions.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Oh. Interesting.,"A: That was, you know, one of the vignettes that I remember.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Yeah. I think sometimes --,"A: And they tried to protect us, I guess.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And also I think sometimes in such dire situations, parents think, okay, we have to do this, this, and this and --","A: Yeah. They didn't discuss those things in front of us. Like, I don't know how the plans were made for us to leave.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: Well, if we have it here I can look at it too.","A: Because I -- you know, the day that we left is stamped on it, but --","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: And so what was the next leg?,"A: As I said, he was born in this little town that was on the boarder of then Hungary and Romania, and the immigration authorities in their wisdom decided that he was Romanian and couldn't come in.

"Q: And the land portion, once you were in Ecuador?",A: It was hairy.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Hairy, how is that?","A: Well, we arrived on the coast. Quito is 9,000 feet and the trains were very primitive. I remember that. And the rails, there's a section of the rail going up the mountains where it's very steep and the train goes up and then it backs up and then it goes back up again, and the place is called La Nariz Del Diablo which means the devil's nose because it's very steep and very --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Was it scary?,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: That could be something Bill --,"A: That can probably be found, yes.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Found for you too. And -- and then you arrived finally in Quito by train?,A: Yes. And we stayed for -- in a hotel -- oh. We arrived in Quito on June 8th.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, good.",A: Which was two days before my 9th birthday.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: So there's a time schedule, because this was June 8th, 1939.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Uh-huh.,"A: And we were in this very dark pension (ph) and somebody, some relative had sent me for my birthday, which was June 10th, a Spanish version of Anderson's Fairy Tails. And I remember on my birthday my father was sitting in this dark room with me and the dictionary trying to read the book to me. And I didn't want to stay there. I wanted to go out with my brother and some other kids who had -- some other refugee kids were playing and I wanted to go play with him, and my father insisted that we read that book. Interview with Eva Desrosiers 38","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So were there other refugees there with you?,"A: Yeah. We met some other people there. In fact, the pension (ph) where we stayed was run by -- I guess they were German Jews. It was called pension noeman (ph). And we were there a few days.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Mension (ph)?,A: At the pension (ph) and then we moved into a house with my aunt and uncle.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: I see.,A: But we did get one with indoor plumbing.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And do you know, were your parents able to take their savings with them or any assets with them?","A: Not right then. Later we -- my grandmother who had stayed in Vienna before she went to Holland was able to send some of the stuff. I remember a doctor came to take our apartment in Vienna to take it over and he seemed very friendly to us, and so he said that we shouldn't worry, that he would make sure that all our stuff would be shipped to us wherever we ended up at; but when my grandmother came to insist on some of the things he said she better not come back or the Gestapo would be called.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Probably if they were going to get something out it would have had to have been pretty soon.,"A: Yeah, yeah. Yes. It arrived while we were still living together.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Kind of surprising that even that made it.,"A: It was funny even when we were still in that pension (ph), word got around that there was a doctor and people would come to my father and he would say, no, I can't see you. I cannot see you. I cannot see you. I cannot work here.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Right.,"A: Because -- and then slowly he started getting people coming and he couldn't say no.One of -- and then while he was trying to get his -- he had to take all the tests of the medical school in Spanish, five years of tests and so he was studying at night and working.

Q: Wow. So the president heard about him?,A: Yes. And --,"[1, 2, 3]"
