""You are hungry. Where is your mother?"" ""At home."" ""And why you are here?"" ""She sent me out."" And then my father went to the judge and said, ""I like to have the right of my children.""

Q: That sounds like a very sad beginning.,A: Yeah. I never had a mother.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Maybe 28, no, 27, and I know about her, and when I was a child -- she is six years younger than me. When I was a child, she said, ""Jutta, what you like, a brother or a sister?""
