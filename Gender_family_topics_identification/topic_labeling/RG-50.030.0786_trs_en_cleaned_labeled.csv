And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled, and -- and yes, there was one occasion when she -- I don't know, you know, she was so tired by then, and -- and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira, that she didn't end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And -- and so this tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they -- and watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the -- the branches from this rubble actually cut the --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Broke the --,"A: -- broke the fall. So she -- she was in there, and they thought -- the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the -- of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. And so they got mad at her for -- for, you know, doing that.And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working -- fixing -- changing the oil on tractors, and also filling -- there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for that. But, you know, in the co -- in the course of all of that, you know, she di-- sheInterview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015 almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the -- the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian's that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really -- she kind of did things that didn't help her, you know, and that's another thing that happened. So when she went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were -- they were just -- you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn't like her.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this -- how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay.","A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten -- like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was actually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn't getting paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever -- was she ever told why she was deported?","A: Because she was a landowner.ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisestecion Interview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: That's what I thought, that's what I thought.","A: And -- and also, I think they may have also known that her -- they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a -- a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there's the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials.","A: Right, they -- the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but they weren't -- they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: So tell me, this incident what -- that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this --","A: Well, that's much later, actually.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, I see.","A: That's much later. Yeah, at-- when -- when my mother and sister were escaped from the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is thatInterview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015 incident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they made it to -- oh, now I'm drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think? A2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, I see.","A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I'm skipping something. There was a lo -- there was -- all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there -- you know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And there was a huge mass of people, and they na -- they didn't know where to put them. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and forth, trying to find a place to -- to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that.And in that turmoil, that's when they met my father again, okay?","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see.,"A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these resettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that's where my mother and Mira were there. I'm not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was many months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so, she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and there were there as -- as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my motherInterview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015 being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense more of the geography. So from what I understand from you're telling me, is that the camp they ended up staying in was bet -- was in Perm, the region of Perm.","A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where they were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk, is that wh-where you were saying?",A: They went to Tatishchevo.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Tatishchevo.,A: Near as --,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: -- for the first time?,"A: Right.Interview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there?","A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and he was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania. And then from there he was sent --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern Poland?,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania?,"A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and -- from the Germans, and they were -- o-or no, maybe it was -- I'm not sure now. I think it was --no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got -- they got caught and -- and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they were sent -- he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.","[1, 2, 3]"

"Q: -- under the Soviets, excuse me.","A: Right, right.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And -- and he was not -- he was not shot.,"A: No, there was -- hi-- at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these officers were being sent somewhere, but they didn't know where. And he was taken, actually, to -- they were going to build an airstrip or something up further north, in the tundra, and -- at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point Germany had in -- attacked Poland -- I mean, Russia, and so they were camped there for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know, th-that -- there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army. A2: Armestu(ph).","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And -- and he was not -- he was not shot.,"A: It was ca -- yeah, was --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah, an amnesty.","A: -- the amnesty. And so then, from there, I-- somehow he -- you know, made his way towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?,"A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and my father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles. A2: Well, no, he's th -- I was holding up a box, a-- a--a matchbox of some sort.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?,"A: Okay.Interview with Mira Zimmerman "" January 23, 2015A2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa -- a pile of rubles, or something like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or -- or d-don't have anything to -- to -- that I would be able to buy some food.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. Okay.,"A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember? A2: Yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. Okay.,"A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and -- and then you came back another time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something. A2: Oh, I think the -- he -- he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids some sugar, and some honey.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I see. Okay.,"A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the children. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that were the same age. I'm sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him, you know, of them.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I see. And did he talk about this -- these stories as well, and this incident?","A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Okay.,A: Our mother.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo, you Mira, and your mom, went further south, is this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and forth?","A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying to find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really, actually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was cold. By then it was, you know, November, December of ""41, and there was very little food, and my mother was -- our mother was trying to find, you know, food, and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually much worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another -- you know, to -- to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money -- she -- they say -- I don't know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him for s -- help, because she really -- they were so destitute, she -- they had -- they -- their luggage was stolen, this is the --Interview with Mira Zimmerman % January 23, 2015 A2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi -- center office of the -- of the forming units.

"Q: Fifteen. And your parents married where, in what -- in what of these many places?","A: Well, they -- eventually, neither one of them was going back to communist Poland, especially since one of the jobs that my father had, he was a second lieutenant, an adjutant, and hi-- one his jobs was to weed out communists from the army, and he's sent quite a few back. And his friends that ended up in England, his soldier friends, his officer friends that did go back to Poland, disappeared. So the -- the thinking was, if -- if you don't go back to communist Poland -- and ofInterview with Mira Zimmerman .deg January 23, 2015course my mother and sister knew all about communism, and they weren't going back, so they -- you know, they went to England, and so did my father, after he fought in Italy, in Monte Cassino.","[1, 2, 3]"
