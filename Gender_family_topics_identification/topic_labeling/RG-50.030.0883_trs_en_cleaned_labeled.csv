"Q: In the 19"" century?","A: Yes. Apparently they came over as young men. Don't ask me when, but they were young. Eventually William moved to Newport News, Virginia.

"Q: And so, you don't have a memory of aunts and uncles coming through, and -- and sort of being there for family celebrations, or things like that?","A: No. The only memory like that is s-say when a cousin, cousin Ruth --","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Okay. Did any of the other passengers make an impression on you?,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: When you were told to leave school, by that German teacher, how did that affect you?","A: I was just bewildered. I didn't know what to think, or what to do. This was an auth -- authority figure, says go, don't come back. What does a six and a half year old boy do to that?","[1, 2, 3]"

And I remember many times Billontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Henry Stern deg June 8, 2016 would go down in the basement and stroked the furnace.

Q: Did you -- did any -- did your family get any help from any agency?,A: I don't know.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay. So this sounds like entirely a private enterprise. Nothing that would have involved a community agency, a Jewish agency, a government agency.","A: Not that I know of. Remember, in order to bring immigrants into the country, the sponsor had to sign a paper, they would be responsible.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: The government didn't want -- couldn't do anything, th -- the government at the time, was handicapped. We were in a depression.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's true.,"A: And in addition to that, you had the American firsters -- isolationists. They didn't want to get involved with other people.

"Q: Politicians have always wanted to stay in power.ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern *deg June 8, 2016","A: Right. So it was up to individuals, and Bill and Roselyn(ph) were granted permission to support 125 people.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Was he particularly well-off?,"A: No, far from it. In fact, Ernie -- Ernestine, his daughter, tells the story of coming downstairs one morning, and found her father with his head in his hands, on the table, worried that he didn't have money to buy food that day.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,A: We were coming out of the depression at the time. How many pieces of china and gifts were -- were being bought at the time?,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Not many, cause that's not a necessity.ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Henry Stern """" June 8, 2016","A: That's right. So, he was struggling.","[1, 2, 3]"

My mother would bake cakes, that she would sell on order, from people in the community. In addition to that, she became the janitor of Rodef Sholom temple. And many is the time, after a rain, she had to go down to the temple and bail water out of the basement.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's not easy.,A: No.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did they find it hard to adjust here?,"A: My father did, yeah. My mother, not too much. But eventually -- Interview with Henry Stern "" June 8, 2016","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: What was -- excuse me for interrupting, but what was hard for him, in the adjustment?","A: He was used to the German way, what he had been doing. He was his own boss all those years, and suddenly he was working for someone in a warehouse in a -- a business he knew nothing about.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Had they -- had he had higher education, your father?",A: I don't think so.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And your mother?,"A: I doubt it. I don't think women at the time, or girls at time --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: It was unusual.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: It was unusual.,"A: But I would say within a year or so, he opened up a grocery, again on 26"" Street, just a half a block up from where we were living. And if I remember correctly, the store was opened after sundown on s -- on Saturday, first day. And Bill Morgenstern came to the house afterwards, and said, how did -- asked how he did, and the answer was, we took in eight dollars. And Bill said, that's great.

Q: Okay.,"A: Again, my father did more of the physical work of going to the slaughterhouse, and bringing sides of beef into the business, and so on.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Okay, so he went back to what he knew.",A: Yes.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: But now, instead of just a butcher shop, it was a grocery store.","A: Right, small grocery, neighborhood.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Did you help out in it?,"A: When they bought a vehicle, which was a quarter ton panel truck -- they don't make them anymore -- I became the driver. And I had to drive my father to the slaughterhouse and back, and so on.","[1, 2, 3]"
