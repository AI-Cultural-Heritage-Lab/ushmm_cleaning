"Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Shimon Schwarzschild, on April 23"", 2017, in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Thank you very much for agreeing to meet with us today, and to share your story. Before I ask all of the questions related to your bio, could you tell me, how do you pronounce your name properly? I'm not sure if I got it.","A: That's wha -- thank you for saying that, I was going to interrupt you. The different parts of my family pronounce it differently. I pronounce it in a more German way, which is Schwarzshield(ph).","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay.","A: Cause it comes -- it means black shield, or black coat of arms. However, other parts of my family have gone to Schwarzschild. So I am Schwarzshield(ph), Shimon Schwarzshield(ph).","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Schwarzshield(ph), okay. And tell me, was Shimon your name at birth?","A: It wa--it was my name at birth, and then i-i-- my parents, who were Orthodox Jewish in a small town, had two lifestyles they lived by. They h-- they -- they had their Jewish names. My father, for example, was Abraham, and they had their token to assimilation, their Germanic names, and his Germanic name, if you'll pardon the expression, was Adolf.ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild : April 23, 2017","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh no, really?","A: And in my case, I was born Shimon, but -- but my Germanic name that I lived for my whole lifetime in Germany was Siegbert.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Siegbert.,"A: And then when I came to this country, I changed it to Bert. And one day in -- of course in California, where else, up in a redwoods trees, I had this flash that said, you've always liked the sound of Shimon, and Bert Schwarzschild is so guttural, and I went to all the bay -- I-I went to, almost instinctively to the banks, to the social security, everywhere, and I took back Shimon.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And about --,"A: And that's about 20 years ago, or longer.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Oh, so when you were in your 70s already.",A: Pardon? I was --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So--,"A: -- yeah, in my 60s, maybe.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: In your 60s.,A: Or somewhere like that.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So --so you had lived a great portion of your life as Bert.,"A: As Bert, that's right. Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild deg April 23, 2017","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,"A: I--so, when I Google myself, the-there's a life at Bert, and a li-- and mor -- the -- and a more recent life at Shimon.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And just a question of curiosity, I hadn't heard that before, though I'm sure many, many people did so, that you have a name that is reflective of Orthodox Judaism, and then another name that is more assimilation --","A: Germanic Siegbert, like sieg heil. I hate to say it, you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Can you tell me, wa -- was there a formal way? Did you have to se -- did your parents have to have formal documents that had one name, or could they have both?","A: Well, when we first came here, I was Siegbert.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,A: And --and--,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's to the uni -- United States?,"A: --I was in the navy, and they used the name of Siegbert. And I -- and believe it or not, when we came to this country as refugees, we had enemy a-alien -- we ha -- we were classi-- enemy aliens, and we had an enemy alien I.D. card with my Siegbert on it, and we were not allowed to leave 25 miles of Jersey City, or have a shortwave radio, which is kind of an interesting thing about -- Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild deg April 23, 2017","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And how long did that last, this enemy alien --","A: It lasted pretty much until I went into the navy, at maybe a -- 18, and became -- and then my parents became derivatives -- got derivative citizenship paper. I'm not sure exactly when the enemy alien category stopped. It was there for the war, I believe, for the duration of the war. So I was in the navy for the duration of the war, but -- but we were classified as enemy aliens.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Do you think you were an enemy alien while you were in the navy?,"A: No, I think -- I--I don't know what my status was then wa --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: -- it opened a lot of doors, because once I was in the navy, then my parents were -- that gave me citizenship in some strange way, and then my parents were able to -- they exped -- were able to expedite getting citizenship papers. They --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: And in Germany, do you know whether in Germany there was a way of recording both your Jewish name, and your Germanic type name, officially, or was that they had to choose one or the other?","A: I think that we were in Germany. I was only known as Siegbert, and my father was only known as Adolf. But what happened is, there were also Jewish records, but what happened, what I understand from -- from the archivist who -- who rediscovered, and gave me my family tree [break] Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild "" April 23, 2017","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: -- and were allowed to have land. You know, they -- they weren't allowed to -- I mean, in general, under the Russian empire, it was a different system of land distribution, and who owned it. Jews managed estates, but very few had -- were farmers themselves. But it was another form of exclusion.",A: I think that -- that exclusion also went on in -- in my region --,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: -- because even though my parents were cattle dealers, and their parents -- my father's father was a cattle dealer, they didn't have big amounts of land. They had -- they owned a house, in -- in the village of Dettingen. And then my grandfather mo -- bought a house in Wertheim, and that's where my father and his brother moved to, to continue their -- their cattle business, even -- even though this meant -- in those days, ha -- being a cattle dealer meant going on a bicycle every morning --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Really?,"A: -- to all the villages, to find out who -- what farmers were -- were interested in selling a cow, or what farmers were interested in buying a cow. So my father -- there were no cars -- he would go out on a bicycle to -- and I would sit on the bicycle if I went out with him, to these different villages. And he would have, in each village, he would have a no -- a non-Jewish schmoozer.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Really?ontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild deg April 23, 2017","A: A man who was like his -- his eyes and ears. And the first thing he would do in the village, he would meet with the schmoozer in a beer garden, and then the schmoozer would tell him the latest -- what farmer had his cow, wanted to sell it, or wanted to buy one. And then he would get -- the schmoozer would get a commission","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: I was going to ask, yeah.",A: --if my father bought or sold a cow that he had told him about.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Now, did your father also have competition?","A: Yes, yes, there were other Jews who were also cattle dealers. There weren't that many in our region, but every Wednesday, there would be a marketplace, right near our house, by the river, where all of the people, the -- the cow -- the cattle dealers would bring their cows, and farmers. And then you meet th-the -- the -- the people from the bigger cities, who were -- worked for meat packing firms would come, and there would be big negotiations, and I would hear them ar-argue over price, and then there would be this -- I would hear this gigantic clap. There were no invoices, and no purchase orders, and once that clap took place, the lives of the people were behind this -- this transaction.","[1, 2, 3]"

Q: How interesting.,"A: -- when I was a kid. And then -- and my father would so-sometimes argue, they would get to so many marks --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Okay.,"A: -- and before they would clap, he would also say, and 10 marks trinkgeld for the children, which meant, a additional 10 marks for my savings account.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: And did he get it?,"A: And they would argue over that, and they would be included, and then I would feel good, be -- I never saw the money, because it went into a bank account. But it would include five or 10 marks of trinkgeld for the children.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How cool is that?,"A: Yeah, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: You know, it must have been like a -- I can imagine, as a little kid, to be accompanying your father as he does his business is a very important role. And then to witness this is also interesting, cause for kids, everything is interesting.",A: [know.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: And actually, you know, my biography that I'm writing, I-- I -- I'm titling it, ""Drinking Krambambuli."" And you probably have never heard of krambambuli,ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild "" April 23, 2017 but what would happen is, when we got to a village, and you got into a tavern, I would be thirsty, and -- and -- and there was a -- ye -- he would sometimes buy me a soda, called Sharbaso(ph), which was the name of the company.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Sharbaso(ph)?,"A: Sharbaso(ph). And we -- when I was in Wertheim the last time, the e -- the deputy mayor actually showed me an old advertising, with the name Sharbaso(ph) on it, it doesn't exist any more. Which was a name of an early pop -- pop drink.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: What did it taste like?,"A: Well, it was sweet. I don't -- I'm not sure any more whether it had bubbles in it. I think it had bubbles.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So it's carbonated.,"A: But -- but -- but then he would say, every now and then, either it wasn't there, or he didn't want to spend the money on it, and he would say to me, drink wasser wie das liebe vieh und denke es ist Krambambuli. Which translated means, drink water like the dear cows, and think it is Krambambuli, and I never knew what Krambambuli was until recently when I Googled it, and I found fe -- [break] -- and he was depressed, and he never -- he -- he never really learned the language. It's a real reversal.

She found a job within days, whereas my father was lucky if he could keep some job in working in a butcher store, a baker, move around sacks of something, or a night watchman, he had a night watchman job, until some burglars came in and -- while he was asleep on one of the department store beds, and -- an- and -- and he was fired from the job, I remember that. My father was -- had a hard time in this country, and my mother was a ballbuster here, she -- she worked from 10 in the morning til six at night, and took care of all of us, and cooked the suppers in advance, or e-- so my father, who would usually be -- often home and unemployed, would heat up the stove -- the -- the meals for us when we -- when we came home from school.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wow.,A: Yeah. So -- so --,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: That's very sad for him, yeah.","A: --so he -- he was a very nostalgic, and very, as I said, romanticist. I wouldn't say that he was a happy go lucky person; he wasn't. He was in World War I. He was -- he was injured, and he -- an-and he kind of had some physical suffering and pain, from broken ribs that he -- he had not -- not -- not in a -- in battle, but he had to take care of some horses, as a soldier, and one of the horses --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Kicked him?ontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild deg April 23, 2017","A: -- kicked him in the ribs. And -- and so -- so a lot of people saw him as sad and sardonic. But on Friday night, when we -- because we were Orthodox, we would -- he would -- we would lie on the couch, and he would -- we would sing songs, and -- and -- or he would tell the stories.","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: That was my next question, is, was he a storyteller?",A: He was a storyteller also.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: A-And -- and he would often read the stories, you know. But -- but he also told stories, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Wa -- and was this a difference from how he had been in Germany? From how you remember him from Germany?,A: You mean when he came here?,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Yeah. In Germany, was he a different type of personality?","A: Yes, yes. He -- he still enjoyed being home, he was not a-- you know, he was not like some of the other Germans in the town, who were always walking to the marktplatz and drinking beer in the -- in the taverns. But -- but in this country, he became very sedate, and in the sense that he -- he would not want to leave the house.And -- and if we wanted to go to a movie house, my mother, who was so full ofontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild 8 April 23, 2017 energy, would literally push him off the couch, push him towards the door, put a hat on his head, to -- to -- to get him to go out with us.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: That's so sad.,"A: And -- and he would feel secure at home. He wou -- he would have a stamp -- he had a stamp collection, and he would work on the stamp collection, or -- he wasn't much of a reader. I think it was more a kind of a form of depression, you know. He would say -- one of his favorite phrases that I remember is, das wasser hat keine balken, you know.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: The water has no --,"A: Locks to hold onto for s -- for life support. When we talked about going out -- he would not vote. Well, of course, Jersey City had a very crooked mayor. But he would not vote, and the only -- and what would happen, he'd be -- he would allow himself to be intimidated. The ward [indecipherable] come to our house, and would insist that he go, and he literally would push him out to the precinct voting place. And that's the only ti -- because he felt all politicians were crooks. But he would allow himself to be somewhat bamboozled, you know. Yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Sad.,"A: But he was a very gentle father, and I appreciated that -- that side of his. He actually, finally did find a profession again, because his brother and he -- his brotherontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild "" April 23, 2017 was a housepainter, and they went into partnership again.

"Q: -- but you wanted to be part of, you know --","A: Yeah, yeah.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: -- like -- like you wanted to be part of your brother's stable.,"A: Because I had been such an intrinsic part. Before the Hitler era, and propaganda, I would spend a lot of time in their homes, I would do things with them. We -- our town would be flooded every year, and I have this vivid memory, the water from the river would come into the streets, and we would put on -- we would put on our stilt-- we would take stilts and we would play in the water, or we'd bicycle through the water, you know. We did all kinds of kid stuff, or we would go up to the haider(ph) where -- and we'd scale the walls of the castle. The castle was broken down. We did things that now are so verboten --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Yeah.,"A: --it isn't even funny. They reconstructed the castle, it's called Klein Heidelberg, small Heidelberg, you know. And it's now beautiful, and there are concerts and Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild 6 April 23, 2017 musical events, and restaur -- restaurants and everything in that castle. But when we were there, was a ruin. And there was fences -- a hole in, that we would go to. It wasn't even covered. And the -- and we were told that -- there were all these folklores, that the -- the robber baron for our castle would kidnap rich merchants, put them in the bottom of this dungeon until they got ransom, and if they didn't get ransom, they remained --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: There.,"A: --remained there. And we used to go and throw rocks down to -- and -- and -- to see this [phone ringing] -- that's okay -- to see how long it would take for the rock to hit bottom, you know, in this dungeon. [break] -- the glass making factories there, and -- and so they had been expropriated, and they had been refugees, and they had experienced some of the problems that it -- Jews had. So they were amongst the -- a major initiative to fund and bring back the Jews to Wertheim.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How interesting.,A: Yeah.,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: How interesting.,"A: And I met many of them, and one of them, who was one of the big glass manufacturers, and was the founder o-of -- which is now a very famous glass museum in Wertheim, they -- they offered my family this wonderful mansion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild 6 April 23, 2017 overlooking the castle, and provided us with a VW convertible, because they happened to be on vacation, and they just turned it over for us to utilize. And -- and --and---and you know, and the other Jews who came back. When I came back -- w- we didn't all come at once, so there was just maybe like a -- a half a dozen, or a dozen families who were wined and dined, and -- and -- and -- and we were hosted by all these different people in Wertheim, but many of them from the -- the community of -- of the --","[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: From Dresden, yeah.",A: -- the east r-- the east German emigres -- emigres to Wertheim.,"[1, 2, 3]"

Q: Wessie and Ossie.,A: That's right.,"[1, 2, 3]"
"Q: Particularly when there was still the wall there, and the different world experiences that they had, the different views of one another that they had. And depending on when these people came from Dresden, whether this was right after the war, or before that wall became impermeable. But yes, there was a different sensibility, you know, in that country, which is one of the tragedies of it. Let's turnontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild "" April 23, 2017 now though, to another -- a factual thing, just so that I can anchor this. Were -- did your parents also come back during that time, or was this just you?","A: Very -- it's very interesting. My brother and I each received invitation. The mayor had actually visited my mother and my brother, and -- and -- and my mother fell in love with him, actually. But when -- when -- but my family took the initiative, I took the initiative. My brother did not, and he refused to go back. For him, it was more an emotional thing. But he had -- he had actually gone to Wertheim as a G.L, he was part of the occupation force -- forces that occupied Frankfurt, and -- and he actually went t -- past Wertheim, but he emotionally felt he could not return. He also -- wa-was a lack of forgiveness involved, also. And my uncle, the uncle I was telling you about, he consider -- called me a traitor for going back. I felt like I had unfinished business in Wertheim. I had as much unfinished business in Wertheim as the people who were dealing with the guilt complexes had, in inviting us back.And I felt that I wanted to get past that.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: So I have another --,"A: And it was -- for me, I felt it was like a transaction --","[1, 2, 3]"

One of the things that I pondered over, and -- and I hope -- well, if you get a chance to read my memoirs, I wrote a poem called ""Return to Wertheim.""","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Do you know it by heart?,"A: I think it's important, you know, maybe I should -- I-- I would love to read it, it's short.","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: I would very much like for you to read it.,"A: I'd love to read it and -- and then talk about it, because it -- it sums up --","[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Let's do that.,A: -- the range of feelings. Can I do that now?,"[1, 2, 3]"
Q: Absolutely.,A: Okay.,"[1, 2, 3]"

The other hundred were killed in the Holocaust, and -- and we hundred, living now dispersed, in a modern day diaspora, from Alabama to Zurich. Was it karma, ESP, Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild "" April 23, 2017 or just luck, that within days after my moment of rec-reconciliation, I should receive an invitation to return to Wertheim, as a guest of its mayor and its residents, who until now, I had rejected and renounced. I returned to Wertheim with apprehension and hope, to rediscover the memories I had left behind. To rediscover the aborted part of my childhood life. To rediscover myself. Now I reconnected with my classmates, who I had seen last, when they shunned me, as they were dutily -- dutifully indoctrinated to do in their eugenics classes, from which I and other Jewish students were excluded, where they were shown drawings of evil looking, long-bearded Jewish men, sucking through straw -- straws, a baby's blood, with glee. Now I reconnected with my child within, with the pain I'd felt then, as one or another turned away in mid-play, remembering that I was a Jew, an un-Aryan, too. Now they celebrated my return, at a special class reunion, the 10 year olds transformed into buxom women and beer bellied men. They listened in disbelief, astonishment, and sadness, to -- to my last experience in Wertheim, at their hands. Quite different from what they remembered, or their consciences allowed them to remember. The gray haired women sobbed, tears streaming down, understanding their part in the tragedy, realizing that they too had been robbed of their childhood innocence, feeling -- feeling so long repressed, and hidden from you -- from view, by them, me, us.

But occasionally uneasiness and paranoia seizes me, especially when I see old strangers, my age, still envisaged them in a Nazi Brownshirt, or a black SS uniform. I resist blurting out, did you leave your uniform at home? Still imagine them once marching and singing [speaks German]. When the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. Deep physical wounds leave permanent scars. Mental wounds are no different. Their scars are hidden, but there, capable of flaring again. My return to Wertheim enabled me to revisit these wounds and scars, to look at them closely, to pay attention to them. But also, to see them in perspective. I can better deal with them now that I'm more at peace, accepting that for better or worse, a part of me is German.

Well, I did a little bit of maybe making some corrections, but by and large, the whole thing came out because I remember that when I read it, I read it in class, you know, we were like in a class, and the teacher asked us to read it, and she said that's a very powerful poem, you should try to get -- read it to others, you know?

""I walked in a dream, past the empty lot, where once stood the simple, one story synagogue, victim of the flames of Kristallnacht. I walked past my memories, memories of singing, praying, chanting, of running, shouting, laughing, respectfully dressed in my young boy's finest, coming and going in the house of God.

The synagogue of Laudenbach(ph) is gone, but memories linger on, with Jewish survivors and Nazi's collaborators alike, those few that are still alive, contemplating their own imminent departure, their own past, present and future, and the final judgment being made in the hereafter of their lives. Sequel: I walk past that empty, holy spot, to the modest cottage across the street, where my grandparents once lived, and cross the street to pr -- to pray, their house still standing, as a witness to the past, the sweet and terrible past. Except for the old man in the doorway, who is quizzically eyeing Karl and me. My German friend and neighbor of my childhood, who had driven me to Laudenbach(ph) to help me revisit my childhood memories. Here's Jacob's(ph) grandson from America, Karl explained to the old man. He wants to visit his grandfather's house, with your permission. Could he look inside? The old man's face went ashen. He trembled, tottered, almost collapsed, then shouted, I paid Jacob(ph) for the house in full. I bought it in good faith, a long time ago. He shut the white, picket gate, to keep out the visiting demon from America, who had come to -- to -- to devour him. Afterwards, my friend Karl explained, no doubt that man had been a loyal Nazi, rewarded with a purchase of the house, bought cheaply, through blackmail andontactrefieannedjustanmiang er hither btemelortabnattfiexaliaton Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild * April 23, 2017 intimidation, after the terror of Kristallnacht, after the synagogue was torched.

Not with the SS trooper -- troops who goose-stepped past our house one dark forbidding night, their black, shiny boots reverberating on cobblestones, singing, no, shouting in o -- in cadence, when the Jewish blood spurts from the knife, then we will all be free. The tune has etched itself so deeply in the cells and inner rec-recesses of my brain, that I find myself humming the gruesome words, and the musical cadence that emerged together, until I am startled by the memory of that night, and by -- and by my masochistic instinct to remember the event, an epic, that turned me into a scared kid. We fled the bubbling cauldron that was to become the Holocaust, and crossed the Atlantic, to the land of cowboys, Indians, and streets paved with gold. To jobless America, in Depression, but breathing the air of freedom. As the family eked out a living, each one of us working for the Yankee dollar, in order to survive and thrive, strangers in a strange land. I was hurt by our frantic, frenetic exodus, and angry too. I hated everything German, even though I was German, too. Reminding myself that my family, and the town's Jewish community, too, had our roots in Wertheim since 1405 A.D., as the gravestones testified, before the Nazi bullies toppled and smashed them, as a finalontectnetbnancedjushetnney for father Hlonmalberabouttfiseetecion Interview with Shimon Schwarzschild >> April 23, 2017 insult to the dead. Wasn't it enough that they had toppled and smashed the lives of the living? I joined the navy to fight the Germans, and was sent to the Pacific, in true snafu fashion, to fight the Japanese instead. In the postwar era, I shunned everything German. I refused to socialize and fraternize with Germans. | refused to buy anything German. I refused to make love to Germans. I refused to ride in a German car, especially the Volkswagen that Hitler had extolled. Until one day, I confronted myself with this enigma. Hitler stereotyped all Jews, as universally evil, to be excised, gassed, eradicated, destroyed. Now, I was stereotyping all Germans, shunning and reviling them, finding them all universally guilty, declaring them all universally responsible for the death of seven million Jewish brethrens. I woke up to the realization that postwar Germans who were born after Hitler, were as guilty of the Holocaust cruelties, as I was guilty of the native American holocaust that occurred 100 years ago, right here in California, a bounty on their scalps. Right here, in the good old USA, the land of Washington and Lincoln, the land of Wounded Knee, and My Lai massacres, and many more. So I made a conscious decision to stop my own brand of blind hate and intolerance. The same kind that I experienced from the Nazi bullies in their time, who shouted obscenities and insults at me, without ever bothering to know me.

And you know, there are a lot of unanswered questions, and -- and I--I--Is---don't know what a lot of the people were doing. They were all caught up in -- in their lives. My br -- the one classmate who's left was -- was in -- conscripted in the army, was sent to Russia, was -- became a prisoner of war for two years, or three years, he was in a Russian -- the worst possible condition Ru-Russian prison camp, and he survived, and ultimately he came back. I don't know whether he joined the Nazi party or not, the chances are, he did. Everybody did. Ye-Ye-Ye -- I remember that even as a child, if you -- if you wanted to -- th-the -- the bully boys, the Brownshirts, would boycott stores, Jewish stores. We had a MH -- a department store in the town, Max(ph) Held, h-e-I-d was the name, Max(ph) Held was the owner, Held was the department store.

So my father, his business depended on the -- the crop next summer, you know. If a farmer bought a cow from him, he would pay the debt back maybe a -- when the -- when the crops came in. So -- so a lot of those farmers stopped doing any business with my father, because they decided that the law allowed them not to pay my father back. And -- and I remember, I have this one very vivid memory of waking up like one, two in the morning. We had like a bell, an old fashioned bell which you pull, in front of our house. And the bell pulled, and I went to the window, I woke up, and I saw a farmer standing there, with a cow.

I haven't -- I need to Google that, I haven't Googled that.
