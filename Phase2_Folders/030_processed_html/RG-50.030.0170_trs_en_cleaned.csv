Question,Answer
Q: Can you tell me your name please?,"A: Johanna Newman, which is a rather difficult name to put on for this country that's what it was."
Q: Where were you born?,"A: I was born uh on December 2nd, 1930, in Hamburg, Germany."
Q: And did your parents ?,"A: I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life. My cousin Stephen was born in 1936. I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in Hamburg. Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company. Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years. I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life.She still managed to get out of Germany. She was in America and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early ""60's. Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in Berlin.Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War. She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her. I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh . Uh I did visit these grandparents in Berlin several times. I'm not quite sure how often and they came to visit Hamburg but uh that grandfather also died very early, in March of 1936. So I don't have too much of a recollection except that I do remember him. a very stern man, very religious man, very learned man as a matter of fact in both the working and religious category."
Q: ?,"A: Well, mine was really very good. Uh I have a very recollections of being a little bit spoiled, being that I'm the only grandchild or was the only grandchild until uh I was five years old.Uh I was taken to many places. My parents took me to uh parks, theaters, etc. We lived ina very lovely neighborhood in Hamburg. I had wonderful toys, and with the uh birth of my cousin who of course almost became like a brother figure to me since I was an only child, uh life was wonderful. I spent an awful lot of time, many hours with my aunt and unale, and as a matter of fact, the relationship uh with that aunt and uncle and my other aunt, and I will mention their names.Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children. have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have. Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave Germany which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared. They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left Germany after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938. She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do. Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now school started for me.And I entered school, the school year of 1937, school in Hamburg uh called at one time School. Rather famous for it's girls school of uh high but by the time I went to the school it was no longer called . I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the Jewish community uh center, community council or whatever it was called in Hamburg when Jewish children no longer could attend school. And I went to this school. The school was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called Hebrew day school, a half-day uh singular subject and half-days. Unfortunately I only went to that school for about a year and a half before we left Germany but the year and a half I was there were very happy years. I remember my some of the girls that went to school and in particular the daughters of my parents"" friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr.Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children. Sorry. Two daughters and one son. One of the daughters, . The Meyers immigrated with us to Albania and the Millers went to America and , but when I came to America after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the clouds over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect. Uh in particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously UhI spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother. Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her. Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to Berlin, and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our home and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing. And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than. Uh and as I say, I think that the first clouds that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our classroom and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into Hamburg uh please leave the room. Your parents would like you to come home, or whatever she said. She certainly didn't say that they were going to be deported that very same day but this was the beginning of the deportation of uh Polish Jews in particular. I, perhaps it was other Jews as well, I'm not sure. But I think it was Polish Jews primarily were sent that very day, that same evening, out of Germany and back to the Polish border. I think that the Poles didn't want them, and the Germans didn't want them. I do remember that there was a child of a SpanishPortugese family in my class, and he was the rabbi of the uh I think, I believe the one and only Spanish synagogue in uh all of Germany, and she was in my classroom, and I think that she also was called out. I'm not, I couldn't uh vouch for that. But children of Polish parents weredeported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938.Obviously that left some impression on all of us children. I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children. Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht. And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event. Like every other morning I went to school, and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night. I was sent to school like every other morning, and my way to school passed a big uh Synagogue, the center of ,Jewish life in Hamburg. And in fact the city of Hamburg has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of Hamburg where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big synagogue was. Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent exhibits. I think the place where the synagogue stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful. But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to school, and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the synagogue, and throwing stones windows. And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the place itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming. I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there and throwing stones into the stained glass windows was enough to make us and arrived at school and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up. We should remain calm and we wouldn't have school that day. And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's home where my father already was. And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the synagogues all through Germany had been set on fire, destroyed. were burned in most cases. It is known that in Hamburg sacrificed themselves to run into the synagogue to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so. Uh that the had been demolished.merchandise had been thrown into the streets covered with water and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction. Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the downtown area of Hamburg. He came back . In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh police stations and eventually ended up in Dachau or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh concentration camps. I'm not sure whether Mauthausen was already in existence but Dachau and were. And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name.and he had arrived at work and was immediately taken by the police to . We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my grandmother had a uh apartment that looked out on the main street, the and from the window we could watch much of what was happening. Uh since my grandfather had passed away in 1935 and it was known that there was no man living in her, in the apartment, and she had a very large apartment which ran from one side of the street to the next, uh my father, another elderly gentlemen and a friend of their family decided to spend the day uh in the back rooms of this apartment, and indeed that day nothing really happened. No SS men or no uh secret police came to uh my grandmother's house. We didn't know of course thatthis was a pogram (ph) that would last for an entire week. We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever. And at night we did go home uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own home and he was not going to be intimidated. And we did go home that evening and uh slept in our apartment. I don't believe that too much happened during the night. They may have knocked on our door. We didn't answer uh the door, but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody. Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of town and I'm not sure how they made their way, to summer resort called . It's outside of Hamburg. It was the for being prepared for uh Palestine at that time, and also a children's home. In fact I spent one summer there as a child. And uh this uh was surrounded by a forest, and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the forest. Maybe the nights too.for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone that was there. My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people. All kinds of gloves for different professions. And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at home, which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the Museum is interested in it. Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry. And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in Germany, across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this business that he had built up in Berlin, worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in Germany, his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible. Uh Jews were no longer allowed to . Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939. It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as ""39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name. And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name. All women became Sarah and all men became Israel. So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter. And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name. And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't. Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the Iron Cross. He had received in 1935 a cross which was given only to all front line fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the front line, and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out. I mean that was something . [believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans. Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet panic. To be told that they were going to go to labor camps or we were being resettled in the east and didn't know where they really were going to. . OK. Uh it now becameobviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life. I'm a child. I'm panic- stricken or very fearful. The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear. Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms . Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh shelter, even at that stage of the game. But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out. And we had to stay in our apartment. The sirens would go. The uh uh fire department would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear. I mean I can feel that fear even today. I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went home to uh back to our own apartment Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken. I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean. And the tremendous fear . Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, ""36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of and these would be broadcast on the radio stations. And people would put on their radios, and I remember but this must have been summer time. Windows were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again. I could feel it like I felt it as a child . So the feelings uh the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, I don't think that anybody every really can completely forget that kind of fear. Well the world became very insecure as I said. Uh many friends began to leave. Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at school, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and three children, and my parents trying to find a place to go. Now the obvious was of course to go to America. My two aunts by now were in America. They had began to send us affadivits and all the supporting affidavits and uh supporting letters and security and whatever else the American consulate in Hamburg demanded, and we were registered, but because of the uh trust that my father had, and this here, I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long, and perhaps even felt, had a feeling of ... ... and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again and I could feel it like I felt it as a child of six and seven and eight. So the fear existed and the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, and I don't think that anybody ever really can completely forget that kind of a fear. Well, the world became very insecure. As I said uh many friends began to leave. Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at school, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and the three children, and my parents, were trying to find a place to go. Now the obvious was of course to go to America. My two aunts by now were in America. They had began to send us affidavits and all the supporting affidavits and and supporting letters and securities and whatever else the American consulate in Hamburg demanded, and we were registered. But because of the uh trust that my father had, and this and this here I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long time, and perhaps even felt, fear, had a feeling of of un grudge against my parents for this feeling of security that they expre...that they had for living in Germany, and I didn't understand it until recent years when I have read many stories of other people like myself who came from German families and where the feeling was exactly the same, where the attitude was the same. They were Germans. They had lived in Germany for generations. Uh I know that my mother's family, I myself in my book have traced back the family for a little bit over two hundred years, and I haven't done a verythorough job, so I'm sure that I can go back much further. Uh my father's family even though he was born in which was the heart of Prussia, uh under American law after the after the uh Ist World War it had been ceased (ph) to Poland and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to America before the war. But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German. And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them. Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the in the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place. I I'm not sure. But nevertheless this was the feeling. So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota. My mother and I both having been born in Germany had not, no great problems. The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for America several times before leaving for Albania. I think we were called to the Consule at least twice if not three times. However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier. And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead. I believe did. So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave Hamburg. They had to also find another asylum. And it was exactly that. It was a search for an asylum no matter where. And uh the passibilities were very very slim. They thought of England. Well England required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered England.I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out. Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in Argentina. Was very difficult to get into Argentina. You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove. He was a business man, through and through. So that was out. So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this Albania uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to Germany at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go ona honey...his honeymoon to Switzerland. And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money. He got us in return, perhaps not in return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery. I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to Albania. And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to Berlin for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure. At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an airplane back to her would have been absolute uh disaster. I mean how does anybody go into an airplane. But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before. At any rate we did get visas. Uh and uh now the process of leaving Hamburg mysteriously began. My recollections on that are very very sad. Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's. Today I'm pretty close to that and Iconsider myself not an old person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like Albania and this is all we knew about Albania. Uh she was left alone in Hamburg with an older sister. Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to America were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in Posen (ph). I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in Posen of course. Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in Hamburg. That was very sad. Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in Hamburg. We had to give up our things. We had to give our home. Uh and we thought that we would go to Albania, transfer our documents with the American Consule to the American Consule in , which indeed we did and that we would go to Albania for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year. Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long. Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of luggage that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, it was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in Albania. Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939. We're not allowed to take out any silver. We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person. Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry. We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased. I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations. I believe that in my papers at home in Haifa I even have lists of things my parents took with them. I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort. I mean everything was made very clear. They packed a lift (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials. Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these lifts were left in the storage of the harbor in Hamburg with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in America we would send for these lifts. I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your lift to the United States, and it makes sense, because I think the United States, or the harbor of New York would have been flooded with lifts of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there. So our lift was left in uh Hamburg, in the uh harbor of Hamburg, and uh we left Hamburg on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939. At least this is what the official exit document that I have states. Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc. It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him. These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war. Uh his younger brother had fallen for Germany eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in France. Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919. She had gone to Berlin to wait for him as he arrived. He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into Russia and never came back from the war until February 1919. Uh she was in Berlin. She awaited him at the railroad station. And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza. She went back to Posen and died very shortly thereafter. And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier. Posen by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into Posen. Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in Posen was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for theGerman citizenship, and they all went to live in Berlin. So as of 1920, I believe that uh all whoever was left in Posen of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in Berlin. But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the building where we lived, that he could use the furnace room of the house and burn all what he couldn't take with him.Papers, documents, etc. etc. He took some things with him, but very few. We were so limited in our baggage and our luggage that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take. Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the house that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along. The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the house.Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us. One for each of us, and nothing more. And her jewelry. When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his business. And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along. They were pa...that is to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us. Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this place, packed in a sealed little package. I still see the package in front of me. It was very small and it was sealed with seal-locker, actually sealed, and I guess included was a list of items that were in it. And a copy of that list, when we finally left Germany and crossed the Pass into Italy, that list was over there with the customs official, officials. My parents were taken out of the train when we uh passed across the border and uh the package at that place was opened up and they compared the list and contents of that package with the list that they had received. That's how strict things were handled in those days. At any rate, the day of departure arrived. I remember all night long my parents were still packing. I remember the last night in our home. Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother. I still re...see her standing on her balcony and waving at us as the taxi drove away and took us to the railroad station in Hamburg. We left from the railroad station called and uh I took a doll with me. I took a ball with me. I remember a little pin that my grandmother had given me and a few other toys.And uh we traveled to Munich and slept the first night in Munich and continued the next day to Italy. That is to say we crossed the Pass. My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the plane...out of the train and uh some of them were even uh bodily examined. Now my mother was taken into one room and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the train. For some reason the Meyers were not examined. As I said, people were taken at random. And uh remember my mother coming back on the train and telling us her experience and among other things that the woman who examined her, touched her hair and said what do you have in there, and she said permanent, and uh the woman said don't answer me so fresh. Well, we finally crossed the and uh - look, some people smuggled things out.That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives. It was money smuggled or perhaps between pages of books and it was uh people had false bottoms to their pocketbooks or suitcases - who knows what. I know that my parents at that point were fearful enough not to do that because the results were well-known. They had friends whodid this, and whose husband ended up for many years in prison, and uh we left with the ten marks per person. We left with the little package that was packaged in Hamburg, and that's all we had with us. We arrived in Bologne the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in Munich and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the platform in Bologne and really didn't know where to turn. To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of Italy, and apparently in many such centers of uh cities where trains would come from Germany, these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing Germany. Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful hotel. And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in America, and the same went for the Meyer family. Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went. But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in Bologne who also took us around town, showed us Bologne, fed us, took us to restaurants, and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh passage for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from Bologne to Bari (ph). In Bari we took a boat to Albania. Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two tripls, because this was out of territorial Germany. They would not allow us to pay with German money in Germany for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans. Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called. And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back. Of course it never did. By the way, speaking of the lift in in Hamburg, many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the German court somehow found out that uh indeed there was a lift stored in a certain man's uh warehouse uh which had been distributed. The contents of not only our lift but I suppose many other people's uh lifts, had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families. And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early ""60's as compensation for the lift. Anyway, we're now uh in uh Bologne. As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , . She writes about the Italian Jews and Italy and its Jews, etd. It's a fantastic book I think. Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention Albania at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in. Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about Albania and the Italian role there. But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the border to make their life more pleasant and easier. And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time.Anyway, we now leave for Bari, and immediately take uh a boat and the money that we could afford was only for sturge (ph) or storge (ph) or whatever you call it, in a pl...in the boat, that is to say down in the in the bottom of the boat. We crossed for twelve hours into Albania. Everybody was seasick. This is uh the Adriatic Sea in March - can be rough and it was rough I assume. And we arrived very early the next morning in the port or what you might call a port of Albania, of Duratso (ph). My first impression..."
Q: TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1 Q:,"A: Uh well, the uh one night the shooting at dawn didn't stop. That's quite simply what happened, and this was now the beginning of December 1944. Uh we actually, it was so close to home and we, I mean all night long we were just lying on the floor taking shelter under the beds or taking shelter under a table. I mean it was all really nonsense, but that's what we did. And as the rule was, that as soon as it got light outside the shooting would stop. Well that day the shooting didn't stop. And so we understood that something out of the ordinary had happened. And uh sure enough uh fairly uh soon - I don't know, maybe nine, ten o'clock in the morning - there was a knock on the door, on the portal, and uh my father took all of his courage to his hand and opened the door. I'm sure he expected that German soldiers would be outside and were getting us finally. Uh two Partisan soldiers stood there in their green uniforme with the red star, communist star, on their hats. And we understood that during the night they had occupied half of the city of and we were the second house in from the corner and across the street were the Germans and on our side of the street were the communists. Well, they told us that uh they would suggest that we leave house because we were much too close to the line and they didn't know what would happen. We should quickly take a uh few belongings and go up the street and there was a uh wellconstructed brick house and with a shelter and we should go there and stay there for a few days till ....Well, we did and uh we found other Albanians there. Uh none of our own pleople lived in that uh area at all, so were really on our own completely there. Uh the only other people that we knew on the street other than our landlord and land lady - and our landlord wasn,""t there because simply he had escaped into the mountains.He was a loyalist and he knew what was happening, that the communists were taking over, so he had to escape because of that. Uh the only other family was a German family, no, a Swiss family, and they were Christian Scientists and they had lived for m,any years. Anyway, we spent the night there, and what they had done was literally organize in such a way that people slept in shifts, with just a few bunks and they let people sleep a few hours and thenother people. Suddenly in the middle of the night uh somebody shouted and screamed and we all went out to look what happened and half of the city of was ablaze. The Germans in their retreat, and they hadn't retreated completely yet, had set the entire old market places on fire and there was a tremendous . Uh the next morning my parents decided that uh there was one family by the name of who all along had lived uh way out of town. Way out of town, quite near the mountains, uh the beginning of the mountains I think. And uh so they decided to leave this house and to uh to go there with me, and we really made it in a few hours walking time we made it there. Uh many times uh had to lie down or take shelter of some way or other because the shooting was going on, and uh we finally got there and of course they said that we could stay there. And they left me there and they took my, and my two parents, my parents decided they better go back and take a few belongings, and some clothes and some things, valuable things. Valuable things, whatever there was out of their apartment and then come back and stay. Who knows how long the war will take. Well, they did make it back, and they may, and they did take some suitcase or two and put some belongings in there. And on the way back, indeed they were caught by cross-fire and uh my father shouted to my mother, in German, to take shelter, to lie down flat on the ground. And a Partisan girl, soldier girl, heard them in German and of course thought that she had red-handed caught two German spies. She marched them into the nearest uh station of the uh Partisan police station or whatever, and uh it was a very close call again, because as they walked in they took uh uh an Albanian out. He was shot right outside this uh compound. Uh God was good to them once again, and uh one of the uh officers inside this barrack, inside this police station, recognized my parents from when we were interned in . He gave them the typical Albanian hug and kiss, and told one of the soldiers to accompany them to where we were staying and warned them not to leave until the end of this. That once he could help them, but who knows what would happen the second time. Well, this war between uh the Partisans and the German soldiers lasted for eighteen days. Uh they needed the route, to keep an open route to extract their soldiers, and they kept it open for eighteen days, and then one day we saw one single solitary British airplane that bombed the escape route for a few hours, and at the end of it all when it was really over, some of the Germans soldiers by this time had deserted, were in hiding - we saw them later on walking around in their tattered German uniforms. And uh and the Partisans were now in charge. Practically speaking in December af 1944 we were liberated by the Albanian Partisans. Uh the Germans had ruled with an iron hand. As I said before, they hung many uh Partisans that they caught.They also blew up homes and this is one sight that will never leave my image - I have actually seen whole houses go up, homes which they suspected that Partisans were either hiding in or belonged to families of Partisans. And they blew up the entire houses. And I can never stop thinking of that, whenever I hear that in Israel we blew a house of the PLO. Now uh..."
Q: (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Is there anything,"A: Ina very very difficult way, because Albanian, the Partisans did not want us to and we were finally literally uh how shall I say, they, the Allies black-mailed the Albanians until the epidemic of the typhoid-cholera uh uh vacinnations. People died very, like like flies, and un finally they used this vaccine by saying either you give us the few Jews who are here and we take them out, or you can't halve any more vaccine. Now we were then taken to aDP camp in Italy and this was our first encounter with the real true story. We did not know, we knew there were - even when we feared to be deported we thought we were deported into labor camps. We did not know the whole story as unrealistic as this may sound - we did not. We came into this uh DP camp one evening and the next morning the only other young man started walking across uh these DP camps were along the coast line in Italy. Uh the province of"
Q: ?,A: To a DP camp. It's called
Q: When did you ?,"A: Not until uh September 1946. And that first morning there we met some of the survivors who showed us photographs and I remember us going back to our parents saying what propaganda they were trying to feed us. The real story did not emerge until days thereafter and very slowly. And uh to a fifteen year old, but she had gotten, she had gone mad.And uh they had taken her to the DP camp where she was taken care of properly, etc. etc.But you realize the war was over in May, and this was September uh yes September 1945, and these are the remnants - they're really remnants. Sick, alone, search for one brother and the daily waiting for the mailman to come and the daily going through lists and lists, Red Cross Red Cross lists, United Nations lists, lists or whatever you, this is un...that's a story in itself.Conclusion of Interview"
