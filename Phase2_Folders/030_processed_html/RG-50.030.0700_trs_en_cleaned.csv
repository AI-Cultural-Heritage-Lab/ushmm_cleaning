You could, for a blouse you could get threepotatoes, or some -- toward the end, the Russians themselves were hungry, so theywould give us a first chaff of wheat. So we burned the chaff on top of the stove thatwas iron, and put in the water, so the water had the taste, and that was our soup thatwe ate.

So what was left, they still had to put the taxed amount to thegovernment, and what was left, so very -- I think they brought it on themselves to acertain degree, that they didn't have too much to share. And then they told mymother they would not have work during the winter for women, and during thespring. So they ordered my mother to go to the county hou -- hun -- county place,which was about 25 or maybe 30 miles away, into Kokpekti, which is likeHackensack here, or whatever, and -- to find a job.
