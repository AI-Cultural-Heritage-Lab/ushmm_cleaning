It's -- it's horrible.Let's not ever allow this to happen again. And course it can -- you know, of coursetoday it's Jews, tomorrow it's black people, the day after it's Chinese people. It --it's always a--"
Q: Take your pick.,"A: -- you can pick a victim anywhere you look. But no, we're all part of the samerace, we're human beings and we need to treat each other that way. Of course, I'monly, you know, sounding off about something that's -- everyone knows is a basictruism. But it bears repeating. I mean, I'm not ashamed that I repeat myself withthese kinds of things. Yes, we're all in it together. It's one world, we're all brothers,we're all eating -- eating and drinking and -- and trying to preserve things for ourchildren and grandchildren and great-grandchildren and the millions of others whoare yet to come. And hopefully, by example, we can -- by doing something about it,by at least talking about things, showing how bad things are not to be -- thatshouldn't be repeated, perhaps someday it'll happen, that people will no longer hateeach other."
"Q: Well, the point -- I think also, if we don't do it, it will be a lot worse.","A: Yes, it will be a lot worse, because the world is becoming more crowded, andthere's less of it, because of climate change, which is encroaching on the lowlands.Islands are disappearing slowly, continents are shrinking and populations aregrowing, and food sources are becoming less abundant. And so we're either gonnahave to get along together, or perish together, eventually. I mean, I know a lot ofpeople say I won't live long enough to see the horrors of -- 0-0-of -- of globalwarming. And in my case that's certainly true, I-- I mean, I don't have to worryabout it happening in the next 25 years, because I'm not going to be here in 25years. But my great-grandchildren, whom I love dearly, will be here in 25 years,and I want them to have a future, as I want everybody's children and grandchildrenand great-grandchildren to have. So that's wh -- that's why we -- we talk aboutremembering."

"Q: You're welcome. And I'll say with this, that concludes the United States",A: Thank you. [break]
"Q: Okay, so we started talking about a few things off camera, that I really asked if","A: Oh, what an interesting question. I can quickly tell you what I brought from hereto Zarasai, and how -- how it helped me integrate into s -- z -- the children's societyof Zarasai. First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen atrain, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far:they were six or seven years old. But there's -- there's so much that never arrived inZarasai for them. And I would regale them with stories about subway trains thatarrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work."
Q: The ones that terrified you so much.,"A: Yes, the one that terrified me. And -- but they -- you know, their mouths wouldhang open, and they would ask questions: how fast does this train go, and is it abovethe ground? And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they're known as theelevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground. And there's a newtrain every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids would say to me, how many trains arethere? And I would say oh, there are -- they go around the whole city, and it's just acontinuous train tr -- bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell themabout trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father. And air -- airplanes thatwe watched take off and land. And they -- they were staggered with -- with curiosity.And -- but then, I learned a lot from them. I learned how to -- I --I didn't know howto swim, so I learned how to make swimming -- what do you call a --"
Q: A raft of some kind?,"A: Thing that you lie down on that supports you in the water, and you -- youpractice swimming."
"Q: Oh well, it's not a raft then, but I know what you mean --","A: Water wings, or something like that."
"Q: Yeah, something like that, mm-hm.","A: Anyway, I learned how to make so many things. We made our own toys, wemade our own wagons, we made our own sleds. We -- we -- [phone ringing][break]"
"Q: So, you said you learned how to make things.","A: The -- I learned a lot of how you -- in Zarasai you didn't have Woolworth's andother stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed. If youneeded a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find outhow to make it was to consult the local people. My friend Karowlka(ph) taught mea lot of things; how to -- how -- how to -- I'Il give you an example of something -- togo fishing was a -- a very interesting occ -- pri-- you know, business for us, and --because the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that'svery easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that's just the rightlength and the right size, and you cut it down, and that's your fishing pole. Now youneed fishing line. Well, you can't use just anything. But there are white horses, andwhite horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here andthere, and you braid them, and it turns into the -- a-and then you -- you have like a --maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and nowyou have a terrific fishing line. The -- the bobber is simple, a goose quill and a cork,and you put a hole in the cork and you put the goose quill through it, and then you The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Nobodyknows how to make a fish hook. And the store always has fish hooks. So we wentfishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish andwe ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also -- you could buy sleds inthe wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play -- play with wood, and wewould make our own sleds, they were simple things, but -- but we di-- we didn'tbother wi -- sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies tobuy sleds. But we made our ice skates."
Q: You made your own ice skates?,"A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece ofwood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of ironunderneath as -- as a runner. And you put the straps -- nail the straps to the piece ofwood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with thesethings and had a wonderful time. So, we learned how -- we learned how to swim, welearned how to ice skate, we learned how -- how to catch fish. In the wintertime wegot -- we got sp -- poles that were similar to our fishing poles, only heavier, and weput a --a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in theice. So -- but all these things were local lore, and you ask people, and they showedyou how to do it, and then you did it, and -- also, there were no street lights.

It just got dark, and the p -- the parents of our friends said, you better gohome now. And now we got a couple of kilometers to walk in absolute pitchdarkness, imagining that there are wolves out there. So, you make a lantern. Andit's very easy to make a lantern, Harry and I made so many lanterns, all made outof little pieces of wood, you -- and you -- you go to a glazier, they cut you a little--alittle rectangle of glass, and you slip it in -- on thr -- three or four sides of this littlething. It's not easy to describe, but just --"
"Q: But you made it, you made it.","A: But we made it. And we felt very jolly marching home in the absolute darknesswith our little lanterns. And we did this with everything. We did this for capturingfruit from trees. The same kind of pole that we made the fishing pole out of, alsoserved to have a hook at the end that you could reach up and snare an apple. So wenever went hungry, because the whole town had nothing but apple trees and peartrees and plum trees, and -- depending on what time of the season, we could alwaysget something to eat that way. And -- but being creative, making things, makingwhat you need instead of going out to buy it, was an experience I"" ll never forget,and it has served me well in the rest of my life because before I go out to buy The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And when I hada house and a basement and a -- and some tools, I made a -- a lot of things. I madetoys for my children. I made, you know, all kinds of things. So I learned a lot inZarasai, Lithuania, which I will never forget, and it's -- any time I'm feeling alittle bit blue, with nothing to do, I think back to those days when I made all thosethings that gave us so much pleasure. And so Lithuania -- for me, Lithuania was awonderful experience. I -- I enjoyed the country boy life. I mean, it was -- it was justlike Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn."
