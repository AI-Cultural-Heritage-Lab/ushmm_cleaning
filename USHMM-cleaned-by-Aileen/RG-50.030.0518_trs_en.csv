And she says, oh, okay, then you can go in the barn and hi -- and sleep there. And we did. And in the morning she came, and she says, I heard that they killed already, everybody in Koretz. It’s -- everybody’s killed. And -- and we started to cry, and we knew that that’s it, they killed our parents and the two brothers. And every morning she would come in and tell us that we must leave because they gonna find out that she is hiding Jews, then they gonna kill her. And that was every morning. And she would bring us a piece of bread and a glass of milk. And anyway, I told my brother, I’m leaving. I can’t stay here. And he says, well, there’s nothing we can do. And I wa -- in the morning, I got up, and I says, I’m going. Because she would come in and she said we must leave. And I said good-bye and I walk out from that barn, and I didn’t know where to go, because we were border with Russia, and that was Russia til 1939, and we were Ukraine Poland.

230,Would you do this again? Would you talk with -- to people about this again?,"To be honest with you, no."
231,Too hard.,"Too hard. No. It’s not a pleasant subject. People ask me, how do you survive and blah, blah, blah, and this. Some people that I am close, I'll tell them, but otherwise, no."
232,What do you think about the museum in Washington?,I think very much. I think a lot.
233,"And all the attention that -- that the Holocaust is getting in th -- in movies, and books these days, what do you think about -- about that?","I think it’s very nice. I think it’s, for people that didn’t go through, they should learn. They should."

237,Have you been to the one in [indecipherable],"Honestly, you -- no. To be honest with you, no, no. He -- he’s -- the -- the rabbi is not my cup of tea. Let him be well."
238,I agree. So what do you think made your son get so involved in the museum in Washington?,"Well, because he knows that my husband and I went through."
239,Went through it.,"And he’s doing this for us. He’s a very good son, and he’s a nice human being, not only because he’s my son, but we appreciate."
240,Is there anything you want to add to this?,Not really. I don’t know.
