42,How did they —,So they had to leave. They had to leave Germany.

There was a — the teacher and the — the cantor, he — they left for a — the U.S., and the — so, there was some [indecipherable] teaching there in the Hebrew school, but we were very — not too — not a great deal, put it this way."

Anyhow, I suppose that was the — the plan to — to make it easier, I suppose. And we lived in — with another — with other three families in one large apartment, which I walked in, by the way, in May, when we were in Constance, which was pretty — quite traumatic, actually.

62,This past May”?,"This past May, right."
63,"How did you feel, standing in the apartment?","A — difficult to describe. It’s — it’s — it’s still with me.

68,Describe your experiences when you first arrived.,"We were taken from the train, as I recall. We were taken from the trains onto camion — trucks. And the — we were pretty — from — from the same community, actually, we were together. And the — that was long way. I believe the Germans probably had an — had a — had — they don’t need the consent, but they — Vichy, France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there. I don’t remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities. And there were quite a few — quite a few children actually there. In Constance there were not too many children, there was just Leo, myself and Hootie(ph) and another child was there actually, or teenager, in this — left in the city of Constance."
69,So you — it took days to get to Camp de Gurs?,"We — I-I don’t remem — probably two or three days, something like that, because we stopped, I think. As I learned later on, there was — we didn’t — Vichy, France didn’t want to accept us, and they — the Germans, you know, tried to — I mean Vichy didn’t have much chance there. So in — we went to the — got to the internment camp of Gurs, and it rained and it was miserable, and we were taken by truck, and then they — first, old men out to — so — so [indecipherable] Simon Interview with Paula Blue "" August 7, 2009 [indecipherable] was a cousin to my father, he Hootie’s(ph) — Hootie’s(ph) father, and they — I remember my mom saying please, please take care of my child, this I remember. And ... and Leo got off with the men, and we went on, and I was pretty desperate at that point. And then they had ilot in Gurs, separate ilots which were barbed wire with some of them double ba — between el — ilots, I think was double barbed wire, between the ilots.

A spozak(ph), a — a bag for [indecipherable] straw that the under-underground [indecipherable] ground. And there were no windows, there were just like — like shutters, like, wooden shutters there, the wooden barracks."
78,And were — were they heated?,"There was one small stove, one small heating stove. So who was lucky enough to get close to it was — was better [indecipherable]. I remember being next to a—a mother and a young girl, who didn’t sp — they spo — I don’t know what they spoke, Interview with Paula Blue "" August 7, 2009 either Spanish or Portuguese, but we just, you know, looked at each other and smiled at each other and she may — she may have been — she was ol-older at that time, she must have been a teenager, 15 at that time. And I remember sleeping next to her, and on the — the other side was my mother. And then they separated the chil — the — I don’t know if was voluntary, who did it, that they took children under 14 into separate barrack and they — but it was pretty voluntary. A — because the food that was distributed was more or less — they did try to give the children preference with food. But I do recall the Quakers, I mean, I think Quakers were very — were quite active in the — in — in Gurs actually. I don’t remember Rivesaltes, but Gurs they were quite active."
79,Can you describe how the — what the Quakers did in —,"I don’t know — I don’t — I have — I didn’t meet them, but we — we did know that the Quakers provided some — provided some food into the — was miserable, the kitchen was in a open barrack like a big —"
80,What kind of things did you eat?,"Oh, it was a sl — small slice of bread, which was divided. And the food itself was a — I remember the first few days when we came, the people of — there were some people there from — from Constance, too, who couldn’t eat it. So they gave the Interview with Paula Blue August 7, 2009 children, gave us the food. But you know, after a few days they become hungry too, and they — they actually ate the food."
81,Your —,"Hunger, I remember. Hunger and cold and wet. And the latrines, open latrines."
82,"You talked about the latrines, they were —","Open latrines, an open barrack, an open — not an open barrack, just a — a raised steps up, and the open — you know, just an open thing in the ground, like a — and the end of — the — what Gurs is known for is the mud. Mud, deep slime and mud that people got stuck in, and couldn’t — couldn’t get their — couldn’t get out."
