Did — did — did — did the Jews and the Gentiles sort of split the wins and the losses more or less evenly, or di — were you the dominant team, or —","Well, I was very good, whether it was baseball or football.

35,Okay.,I don’t —
36,Let’s go back to conscription.,Yes.
37,Were you given the option of the European or Pacific theater?,"Well, let’s — first of all, I was drafted into elev — a — a new organization called 11"" armored division. And we originated in Louisiana. I was in the 42™ tank battalion of the 11"" armored division, and I trained as a tanker. And because of my written tests that I took, plus the — the training I got, I was — I —I—I cou —I could have become a — an officer. At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service, specifically in — in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti- Semitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to headquarters of 42"" tank battalion, and so that’s what I did. And I became assistant to the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on — and as I was — I was — I was transferred to the — the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so that was my title, although I didn’t — when we went overseas, I didn’t do any typing or anything. I w —I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion commander gave instructions — wanted instructions to the — the adjutant. And of course, my being the noncom, I did the — whatever had to be done. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim "" January 13, 2015"
38,Let’s go back to the — the na — the anti-Semitism that you experienced inside the army.,Yes.
39,"Talk about that, the nature of it. How did you feel it, how were you exposed to it?","Well, what happened was, a — a incident, for example, during the growing of th — of the — of the division, of the company, the battalions. People were transferring in and out, and there was a — a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and the — several of — of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I said, I’m Jewish. They couldn’t understand. I didn’t look Jewish, my name wasn’t Jewish. And I says, well, you didn’t — you don’t see the horns coming out? At any rate, I— I had a different feeling with — with these soldiers, who were part of my tank — tank company. And so I didn’t feel comfortable going to officer training, coming back, and dealing with — with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the Germans. So, that was — that was why I transferred to the company. And course we didn’t have any — I didn’t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion headquarters. So that was — that was the experience I had."
40,"Okay. Do you recall when and how you received your call-up notice? Where were you, how did you receive it? Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Gilbert Waganheim "" January 13, 2015","I was in Baltimore on my 21“ birthday.

41,How did you feel about that?,"I took it in stride. I knew I had to go, and so I had —"
42,Where did you first go to training? Where was your initial training?,In Louisiana.
43,What was it like?,Camp Polk.
44,What was it like?,"Well, course it’s all new. As I said, I was in a tank battalion and I was in the — I was in C company, if I recall. And trained with others, learning all about tanks, and the armaments, and I was an expert with — with a submachine gun. Got a medal there, and I learned the 75 millimeter cannon. And I also trained, or learned the .45 pistol. And I learned my — I learned the armaments very well."
45,Was it difficult?,"No, it’s — it’s practice, a lot of time."
46,"So wa-was it a physical challenge, a mental challenge, or —","Well, it’s both physical and mental."

48,Okay. Certainly well enough to be solicited for officer training.,Yes.
49,So.,"But I turned that down, as I said."
50,Right.,"Cause I didn’t feel comfortable if I came back as an officer. Although I recall there was a Jewish officer that was in one of the companies, and I don’t recall many Jewish soldiers after that."
51,"How did you cross over to Europe, by boat?",We went — yes.
52,When and where did you leave?,"Well, let’s see if ... ah, we went over in December of 1944."

57,"What were you doing there, training and —","We were training, yes."
58,What did you think of the English?,"Thad no problems with them. If I recall, I even — I even dated a — a Jewish girl, and invited to — invited to the home, and — but that wasn’t anything more. And then, of course, we went over to France. Let’s see. On December 16, 1944, the Germans lonc — lanced a — a counterattack 50 mile radius in the Ardennes. And let’s see — okay, and then when — wh-when we went into France, our first assignment was to guard the — hold the section of the Moose River, where the German attack was expected, but on the t — the ti December 26, the fourth armored broke through the German lines, and we leave Bastogne, where the 101“ airborne had been — had surrendered, and — and so the evening of December 31“, ar — our division went to — had a 250 mile, or 150 mile march to — to Bastogne, where we were involved with the — the — the ban — Bastogne — what was it called? The — the — let’s see, where we became part of General Patton’s Third Army, and we were in the combat command A, and we went to — we — we went to Rechrival, Belgium. That was our first area, and it snowed very heavy. And a patrol discovered over 101 infantry bodies dead. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim : January 13, 2015 They brought back an SS officer to our headquarters, and — and understanding Yiddish, I attempted to interrogate him, but I wasn’t too successful with the German, so they brought over interpreters from headquarters that took over, and — and — and interviewed — inter — interrogated him. I noticed the captain of D company was angered with the discovery of the American dead bodies, and he took some prisoners, lined them a — on the wall, and killed them. And I recall that I—I had to take the bodies and put them in — in bags."
59,"Did — 1— what was upsetting to command and staff about the American bodies? Was it the nature? Did they appear to have been executed, or —",What?
60,"When you said that you found de — the — the-the bodies, the American bodies.",Yes.
61,And that upset people.,Yes.
62,"Wi — was it — did they die as the result of an — of a — of a combat engagement, or did they appear to have been captured and then executed?",That’s wa — wa — they — they captured and executed.
63,"Okay, so this is what —","Yes. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim ie January 13, 2015"
64,— got everyone —,Very upset.
65,Correct.,"Yes, yes."
66,Including yourself.,Yes.
67,"Right. So you saw both the Americans, and then the subsequent round-up of the Germans as well.","Oh, of course."
68,Okay.,"Yes. Of course, our line companies did the — you know, captured the Germans and so forth. I was in headquarters —"
69,Right.,— and so I wasn’t directly — although — although once — once we captured the — the soldiers is — I was aware of what happened.
70,Yes.,"Yeah. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim "" January 13, 2015"
71,Did you identify those parti — was it thought that those particular German soldiers who were captured were the ones who were responsible for the execution of the Americans?,I don’t —I—I don’t think I felt that way. I —I didn’t know.
72,Right.,I didn’t know.
73,But they were there.,Yes.
74,And you were angry.,Yes.
75,"Okay. Do you real — hang on just for a moment, before we press on.",Yeah.
76,Do you recall your very first engagement with the enemy?,Personally?
77,Yes.,"I suppose it was when — when we captured a officer, and th — and the — the — my battalion commander asked me to interrogate the — he knew I was — he knew I was Jewish, and he thought maybe I had a — a —I was very versed in speaking German, Interview with Gilbert Waganheim "" January 13, 2015 which I wasn’t. So, I— I—I can’t tell you how I felt at the time. I think things lead up to what happens, and you take it as a matter of stride, I — I ge — I think."
78,"Would you say retrospectively, looking back, when you’re there in Europe, the war in on proper, you’re part of it.",Yes.
79,Did you feel that your training up to that point equipped you to deal with war? Did you feel as if you were prepared?,Yes. Yes. As — as all the members of our division were.
80,Yes.,Yes.
81,"What — did you form an opinion of the enemy? Were they good soldiers, sloppy soldiers, were they —","Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha — we set up a camp. I recall that we had some German soldiers that we made KP, and I-I-I was guarding — at one point I was — I was guarding — I —I did a various — various things. But one — at one time I —I was guarding prisoners, I recall telling this German that he wasn’t doing a good job of cleaning the large soup vats, and he tried to — he says, I’m doing the best I can. And — and that ended that conversation. But I — I didn’t really have any direct contact, as such, with — with — with the German soldiers, other than, Interview with Gilbert Waganheim © January 13, 2015 as I said, at one time I was there. O-Other times I would — I would go into a burnt out tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn’t want to leave any s-soldiers behind, so —"
82,So these were Americans that you had to extract?,"These are — th-these are American, yeah. One of the tanks of — of one of our companies. So —"
83,That had to have been extraordinarily traumatic.,"Yes. Yeah. Everything there was — it’s a — but we took things in stride. Soldiers did their job. We — we — we did well, and after — after we left bast — Bastogne, we — we traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany."
84,Were you engaging the enemy as you’re going along?,"Oh yes, of course. We’re all fighting, as 1— as 1— as — as I remember, the main force of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there’s still plenty of fighting going on, and we ge — our — our division fought and engaged the enemies as we went down. And then when we got down to — near Austria, as a — as I told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and — and instructions were that we weren’t supposed to go into Austria. But Patton didn’t like — didn’t — didn’t like that, and so we went into austr — Austria also. And that’s where — okay, and as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the — Austria, and — and Interview with Gilbert Waganheim “ January 13, 2015 Patton didn’t like the — the Russians either. And so li — going down, one of our companies, one of the companies was making — was doing reconnaissance, and on the road — on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa — the commander of — of — of the — of — of the camp, was coming towards them, a — with a white flag, and they surrendered. And it turns out he was telling them of the — of the — of Mauthausen, that 1-it was — it was five miles back. And the reason they — they wanted — they — they gave up to us, is they didn’t want the Russians, because the Russians would — would — would just kill them. And so that was how we learned of — of the concentration camp. The next morning, I went with the battalion commander and the adjutant into the camp. That was my first seeing it. And of course, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of dead bodies. And then I went into the — into the camp, and I went into a particular — wait a minute, I’m — I’m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the survivors. And I asked, is there anything that —"
85,"Now, hang on just for a moment —","Yeah, yeah."
86,You spoke with some of the survivors because you spoke Yiddish —,Yes
87,"— you were speaking in Yiddish — Interview with Gilbert Waganheim ot January 13, 2015",Yes.
88,"— not — not — not English, correct?","Yeah, English, yeah."
89,"Okay, so tell me about your conversations with them.","And so, I said, is there anything I can do. And I recall several coming to me and saying, could you write a letter to my relative in Chicago, if I remember that — that was — that particular situation. And so I took the information, and I did write a letter to I—I don’t recall having an-any copies, so I — I don’t know, bu-but this is my memory, that I wrote a letter and told of that — that this person was safe. And so that stood out in my mind."
90,"What did you think as you were approaching the camp? Before you entered the camp proper, did you know what its purpose was?",No.
91,Did you —,No.
92,"So as you’re approaching it, what do you see?","Well, I saw — what — what happened was, the German — there was a big quarry, and the Germans got cement out of there. And what they — they used, they set up this — th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that — that had to work in — in the Interview with Gilbert Waganheim “ January 13, 2015 quarries. And that is — that is how the camp came about. And the — the prisoners worked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha — wi — wi — the — w-with — wi — which would be the cement that they would be making. So what was my first — I-I — this has been a long time, so I — I really — I really can’t remember how I felt in — in seeing it."
93,"Were there still Germans — and then ba — by that I mean soldiers, inside the camp, or not?","Well, what we did, wa — we — we — tho — our — our line companies went in, and of course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course. And of course our — our company — companies took them out, and we eventually took them back to headquarters. But as I said, I was in the headquarters of the battalion, and I didn’t physically get involved with — with the soldiers there. We — we had our other — you know, others that were doing it."
94,"Once you and the battalion were inside the camp proper, what did you have to do? Did you have to start giving medical attention, did you start distributing food?","Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. We have a — a medical battalion with us, and so they went in and did what they had to do, yes."
95,"And did you feed the prisoners, or was that not in your — did you — did you give them food, did you give the prisoners food, or — Interview with Gilbert Waganheim oS January 13, 2015","I-I—I can’t tell you, but the — th-the company — the soldiers in the — in the various companies did what you had to do. So I didn’t — I personally wasn’t involved with that."
96,"Okay. But you understood, if no — if for no other reason than language, that a very large number of them were Jewish? The prisoners.",Y-Yes.
97,Did you — do you recall how you felt about that?,"Well, I was angry learning of what’s happened, but I — I can’t — I can’t tell you my feelings at the time. It’s —"
98,You said in your written testimony —,Yes.
99,"— that at a certain point, as you are advancing through the camp, you came to the crematoria.","Oh, yes, yes. Here’s a picture of — of the oven."
100,"Now, this is the one that you saw.",Yes.
101,Okay.,"And as I said, when my father had this bread route, and — and — and breads and challahs and so forth, I used to go to the bakery and they had ovens. That’s where Interview with Gilbert Waganheim a January 13, 2015 they made the challahs and so forth. And when I saw this, it 1t — it made it — it brought me back to mind of the ovens in — in the bakery. And so —"
102,"Did you understand when you saw that, what it was used for, and why it was being used?","Oh yes, yes."
103,Was it physical obvious?,"I—I learned — I learned as we went in what was — what was happening, and what they — what did — the Germans had done."
104,And was it the prisoners who you we — that were telling you this information?,I don’t recall.
105,Okay.,I don’t recall.
106,Do you recall how long you spent inside the camp itself?,I was there maybe just several hours.
107,Okay.,"As I said, at the time, we were still fighting in — in — 1n — where was that? In — in — in Austria. Anyway, no, we — we had to leave. But we left behind soldiers that would be doing what they had to do, clean-up and so forth."
108,"Mm. But you were still in pursuit of the enemy, so had to move out. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim ° January 13, 2015","Oh yeah, we were fight — we were fighting in — in a town 1n — 1n — in Austria now. What — if — if you want to take these papers —"

111,— who was in a full retreat.,Yes.
112,Did it change your understanding of why you were fighting the war? Did it change that at all?,"No, we knew we had to fight the Germans. I did learn of — of what they were doing to the Jews. Of course, I didn’t know at the end of the year — at the end of the — how many Jews were killed, and I wasn’t — I wasn’t happy with — with what I’d learned."
113,"Of course not. As you’re pursing the enemy deeper into Austria, at some point, relatively soon, you get word that the war is over. How and when did that happen?","While we were still in that town. We stayed there until the — the war was — then we got news of the war ending. Interview with Gilbert Waganheim “° January 13, 2015"
114,Do you recall how that news was transmitted? How did you learn that the war was over?,"’'m sure my adjutant, my commander learned of it, and I don’t know how. I guess word of mouth."
115,"Were you excited, happy, or relieved to — how would you describe your emotions?","My emotions were — I was very happy, but we had already — we felt that we had captured the enemy in — in — in Austria, and just — just biding there until the war ended."
116,How much longer did you spend in Europe after the war was over?,"I don’t recall. I think — I think our division went back — you know, I don’t recall — the last I remember is being in the — in this town in Austria and telling that the war is over, but I don’t remember how we — how I got home.
