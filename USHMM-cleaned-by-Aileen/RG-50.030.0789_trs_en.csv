7,"Yes. So tell me a little bit. Were you born in a village, in a town? Describe a little bit about the place where you were born.","My parents said I was born in a small town. They were teaching in surrounding areas of Swieciechowa and Leszno, and I lived there until the war broke out. So —"
8,Did you have brothers and sisters?,"I have two brothers and a cousin, whom I call my first brother, because his mother, who is my aunt, my mother’s sister, died of tuberculosis in 19 — beginning of 1942. But I was raised with him. He is, I think, almost a year older than I am, and we were brought up together by my mother and my grandmother."
9,Was — were your brothers older than you? Your —,"No, I’m the oldest one."
10,You’re the oldest one?,Yes.
11,Okay.,"One brother was born in 1940 in February, and the youngest one was born in July of 1946."
12,"Okay. Tell me a little bit about your parents. Who was your father, what was his name? The same for your mother. Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015","My father Jusef(ph) Henry Zurezak was a teacher. He became an administrator, a masters’ schoolteacher, and he was also a violinist."
13,And your mother?,And my mother was a teacher majoring in mathematics and physics.
14,Quite unusual for a woman.,"Well, she had difficulties —"
15,Did she?,"— with math when she started at, I think, the teachers’ sem — seminary in Leszno. And she got help. [indecipherable] f — from another teacher, someone who wanted to help her, saw that she was bright, but she was rather not too well. And it helped that she became one of the best students when she graduated five years later, so — and she loved math, so —"
16,That’s an inspiring —,Yes.
17,"— that’s an inspiring story, yeah. And when you — so if your parents were both teachers, were they very active in the community of students, and — and school activities, and — and things like that? Were they —","Yes, they were. Besides, both of my parents were scoutmasters. Actually, my mother was a scoutmaster of the youngest group, and she had only boys. She « Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 didn’t have — like girls very much. But my fa — and my — my father became a—a scout when he returned to Poland in 1920 or ’22. I don’t remember —"
18,Did your father fight in the first World War?,"No. Both of my parents were born outside of Poland. My father was born in Garnisonkirche, and then they moved to Dortmund, upper part of Germany, and my mother was born in Helma(ph) Wiesbaden —"
19,So their —,— the northwest part of Germany.
20,"Did you have German family, or German roots?","No, because during the partition of Poland, that part of Poland was part of Prussia. So they were taken — my grandparents were taken out of Poland to work, and my grandmother, my mother’s parents were taken to Wiesbaden because my grandfather was a forester and they needed someone to work there. And both he and my grand — my grandmother worked together. She took the administration under her hands, apparently that’s where my mother got these mathematical — 1-1t — influence. And my father took care of the — the forestry, the cutting and the taking care of and so forth."
21,So they must have been bilingual.,"Yes. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015"
22,They must have spoken German as well as Polish.,"Yes, yes."
23,And —,"Except that my grandfather, my maternal grandfather came from a family that, before the first World War, and I think it was at the middle of 19"" century, they met — my [indecipherable] through Turkey from Macedonia, and through the — through the Carpathian mountains, came to Silesia, Shlunsk, and then — and — but my mo — my grandmother was from Vierkapolska(ph), the up [indecipherable] Poland. So somehow they — the families arranged it. He was dark, tall, my grandmother was blue eyed with very light blonde hair, and also tall. So —"
24,"And on your father’s side of the family, how did — how did they end up, it was Garnisonkirchen(ph) —","Garnisonkirche, yes."
25,Yeah.,"My grandfather was a cobbler. He designed shoes and he was a very good cobbler because not only the Polish army, but later on the German army ordered the officers’ high boots to be —"
26,"From him? . Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015","— from him. They brought the materials and two soldiers always watched the staircase, and sat there. He worked sometimes 12 - 20 hours, in order to finish."
27,And this was during the second World War?,"During the second World War, but during the first World War, he was in Garnisonkirche. He — I don’t know if he had interest, or he wanted to — not to abandon the — the — the Polish immigrants that were taken to — ba — by the Prussians to Germany. He received a permission to teach them religion. They gave him only the first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, written in old Polish. And for one hour on Sunday, he taught them the language, based on the Bible."
28,Isn’t that interesting.,"Ah, but also he worked in the underground, because he was working with the Polish workers, and they wanted to — they were fighting for their own rights, in order to receive proper payment, and to be properly treated."
29,And this is in Garnisonkirche?,"And this is in Garnisonkirche, but somehow I think somebody —"
30,Informed on him?,"— informed on him, and he was told that the best part would be if he left — moved northwest, so he — they went to north Dortmund. And from there on he promised himself that he will not return to Poland until Poland had a government. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 The government was established in 1922, so I believe that it took them almost two years to travel back."
31,Amazing.,Yes.
32,It’s not such a long distance.,No.
33,"So clearly these are stories you must have heard growing up, from either your parents or your grandparents. Is that so?","Oh yes, Jaja(ph) would always t-tell me — my father’s father was also named Jusef(ph), and he would — I loved stories. Apparently I was the only girl at that time. I had 11 cousins, including my brothers and my cousin and I was the only girl in that age. I had cousins, girls, but they were older, much older than I was, about 10 - 12 years old. But —"
34,"Well, that makes you quite special.","But I played with them, and when they were quarreling, they always said, okay, we have to have a general. Who is going to be the general? They pointed at me because I was the only girl. Would I quarrel with anybody”?"
35,"Yeah. So, tell me a —a little bit about what happened to your family on September 1*, 1939, when Germany attacked Poland. You were a baby, so — Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski » January 21, 2015","Yes, I was a baby, but my mother told me. My father was in the army. He was already out of Poland, he was actually in the — on the border, Poland — Poland and Germany, past river Oder, because we lived between Warta and Oder. And my mother told me that September 1“, 1931, we became one of the first Reich — the Third Reich of Germany, the Germany —"
36,The [indecipherable] 1939.,"— nine — yes, 1939, we became the Third Reich."
37,"So it was very quick, very quick.","Yes, because it was about 30 — 30 or 40 kilometers past Oder to the town of KoScian, that — it was not very far."
38,Yeah.,They just walked in and marched to Poznan.
39,And what happened to her and you and — what happened after that?,"My mother — my father was in the army, called in August that he should come for to serve in the reserves, but then — well, he was a second lieutenant, being a teacher and a musician. So, he had the right to be called frontow(ph), right away."
40,Yeah.,"And Mother tried to move closer to her mother, who lived in KoSscian, which was northwest of Poznan, and about 30 kilometers northwest of — of Leszno. And 4 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 we were right — few kilometers south. But she told me that she moved from town to town, zigzagging back and forth until she reached KoScian, because it was — she was already pregnant with my brother Andrew. But she reached KoScian and lived with my mother and her ailing sister."
41,That is with your grandmother.,"Yes, with my grandmother, mm-hm."
42,And what happened with your father?,"My father was caught in an ambush in — in the forest behind — around Oder, and that part of the regiment was practically annihilated. He was shot, was wounded. Those that were caught, which were about 10 — he said about 10, maybe 15 people, but no more, cause some of them were very wounded, but were alive. They took them, but he passed out apparently, and after two days, the German patrol was walking with dogs, and they stopped where he was lying, and the dogs know if somebody is gone or alive. And when they searched him they saw my father’s army registration ca-card, a teacher’s card, and that he was born in Germany, so they took him for one of his — one of their own."
43,So he wasn’t —,"They took him to Germany, they took him to a German hospital, and he, after a month, he came, he was well enough to speak, and he was interrogated. And my Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski "" January 21, 2015 father said, I am not a German, I am a Pole. I was taken — I was born in Germany because my parents were taken there. This was during the part o — Prussian partition. So —"
44,And so what happened to —,"— then he was — when he came through, they — because my father, being an officer, he was taken to Murnau, which is Bavaria, to a [indecipherable] camp. That camp was a camp that was dedicated or — or protected by Himmel(ph). And it was a camp to show off how the Germans treat Polish officers."
45,So it was sort of like a show camp.,"Yes. When there was no visitation, they would treat it like any other — well, somebody — a prisoner. And, I mean, they had to scrape food. My father liked to cook, and everybody knew this, so he sometimes actually — I said — he said, I talked at the wrong time and was sent back to the —"
46,The kitchen?,"— kitchen, yes, the ki — the kitchen. And he said there, at least, I could s — I could scrape off the — the peeling — peeling the potatoes, I could as — I could scrape the — th-the peels and — and save it and then cook it behind the barrack, or underneath the bed, or — or so what — or whatever. So —"
47,"So in other words, it was a show camp only sometimes. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski » January 21, 2015","Oh yes. They had an orchestra, he played in a co — a symphony. There was a theater, there were — they had lectures, because there were quite — many professors. Polish officers and intelligentsia were sent there. So — and he stayed there til the end of the war."
48,Oh my.,"When an American general was passing by, he opened — my father was right on guard at that time by the — by the gates. He opened, and he — that’s where my father learned some English, cause they wanted to show off that you could take English, you could take French, other — to improve yourself, to show off that you — that — that the Germans were treating them properly."
49,And so that’s why he could practice his English,"Yes, yes. And when he said, open the door, my father said, that was the first command of a different voice asking. I didn’t know what to do. But he said open the door, and he showed them what to do. So the other fellow who was with him, they opened the gates, and he went through, all around. And said, you, where 1s your family, do you have a family? And — and he said, my wife and children are in — in Nordhorn, in northern part — northeastern part of — of Germany, right next to the Holland border. So he said, I’m going to Munich, hop in. And one — as my father hopped into the sidecar of the motorcycle, he hurt his leg. By the time they 14 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 got to Munich, my father was collapsing. He had a cut on his right leg, and he already had poison. So they kept him there. But my father had a letter from my mother, who could write to my dad in Murnau only three times a — every year — every quarter, she could. Every four months she could write a letter. And she wrote to him that we are in Nordhorn."
50,"So that’s in the northwestern part of Germany, if it’s close to the Dutch border","Border, na — yes —"
51,Yes.,"— northwestern part of Germany, right. Right."
52,And — and so he’s liberated by an American general.,"By an American general, yes."
53,But —,And he left him there because the — because he — my dad needed —
54,Medical attention.,"— med-medical attention, and this was sometimes in beginning of May, and we didn’t see him til a month and a half later, when he came to Lingen(ph)."
55,"So for all intents and purposes, your father was — survived the war, but he was out of the picture — Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski » January 21, 2015",Right.
56,— as far as your life was concerned.,Right.
57,"You — did you remember anything of him in your first years, or is the first time you remember seeing him, is that month and a half later, when he shows up?","I didn’t — I knew only my father from the photograph that was standing on — on the the table, on the side table at home. And in-in-in the place where my grandmother lived, and when I saw him, as an almost seven year old child, I looked and I said, that is not my father. My father was a handsome man, with a bushy hair. This 1s a sick man, this 1s — cause when I saw him in Lingen(ph) in 1945 in July, I saw a man bent over, grayish hair and — and his face was grayish, it — he looked like he just came out of a tomb. He could barely walk, he was so weak. So, it was at — that’s the first time I heard him, after all these — after six years of not seeing him. Cause I was a year old when he left."
58,Yeah.,"When he was gone, and I did not see him before. But we, my mother and I, we stayed in — in KoScian. It’s through June of 1944."
59,So you were there for five — five years.,"Yes, yes. - Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015"
60,And your — and your first brother was then born —,In 1940.
61,Okay.,Yes. He was almost four years old when we were taken out.
62,"Okay. Was your — was your mother able to write to your father? Did she find out, did she know he was in this prisoner of war camp?","She found out through his — through his parents, who lived in the same city."
63,And —,My — yes —
64,Okay.,— my — the Zurezak family lived KoScian.
65,Okay.,And — and my father — my grandfather was the — was the shoemaker.
66,"Ah, so —","But — but what happened is that my mother was notified by her father-in-law where Jusef(ph) is and that she can only write once every four months to him. And so they — so that they, many times — my mother taught me that she would put her letter with their letter, in order to make certain that it gets there. So my father sa — had some letters when he came in 1944, when he appeared, because he kept "" Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 certain letters. But certain letters, I’ve noticed that 1t was only my dear, or my beloved, and everything was blacked out."
67,Really?,"Only he would — and [indecipherable] I’m kissing you [indecipherable]. That was all, because whatever he wrote in it, was apparently unacceptable. So somebo —all the letters were read through before they went to the — to the people, on both sides."
68,Did he know that he had a son?,"Yes, yes, and he knew —"
69,And so they let information through.,"Yes, yes, that info — yes."
70,"Okay. And did you see much of your father’s parents, as in those first years?",Yes.
71,Okay.,"Because we lived — he li — they lived behan — be — further from us, where the town square was, and a pond where beautiful white swans san — swam. And I enjoyed the swans. It was — I always ask my mother, please can I go to the market and buy — she says, but you’re only four years old. I said, Mama, I want to go and is Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 see Grandpa, but I want to also see the swans. And I would always have a few crumbs of my bread left for them so I could —"
72,Feed them.,"— and they would — yes, and feed them."
73,Yeah.,"But we — we visited them quite often, as was allowed. We could not visit them during air raids, or when the soldiers were marching, practicing something like that, no."
74,Was the town full of German soldiers?,"Yes. We lived right across in a house, only in one room on the third floor — well, I mean, I — European would be second floor. But across the — the palace, which once belonged to my father’s great-grandfather."
75,Oh wow.,"And well, unfortunately, the SS cavalry occupied that. So — so we were very, very watched. And —"
76,You were watched because of that family connection?,"That I don’t know. We were watched because my fa — my father being in Murdenau(ph), an officer, and they did not like my mother, who did not look very Polish. My mother was dark skinned, with pitch black hair and dark eyes. Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski "" January 21, 2015 Slim. And she was petite, and they always called her — she had a name, of the black crow, they called her."
77,The back cr — the black crow.,The black crow.
78,Yeah.,"Yes. And my mother, my brother and I were witnesses. Three times she was called. She rece — received a notice that she has to show up at the wall of the square where many executions took place, and th — the family, her family, that means my grandmother, my cousin and the two of us had to go and witness. And of course, most of the people were there too, witnessing who was being —"
79,Executed?,"— executed. And they always left my mother til the end. My mother was al — and I remember her, she was always dressed in a black skirt, black shoes, black stockings, a white blouse, and she would walk in, and when they went to put the — close her eyes, put the band on her eyes, she says, I don’t need it. And then they would get ready, and the commander would come in and say, not today, black crow."
80,"So this was a mock execution of her? 50 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015","Yes, yes. My — my mother was — when they, of course, was over, the commands were given, the SS left, the people were looking around, they said, oh, next time again. Next time again."
81,And so you —,"So three times, it was 1943, and 1944 was the last time. I think it was in — right after Easter, which was April."
82,And you’re a five year old child?,"I was five and a half. I was waiting — September wa — in ’44 was going to be my sixth birthday. I mean, not — not September, Au-August 23"" was going to be my next birthday, when I would be six years old. But at the age of four, I knew how to read, how to count, and how to write. And when somebody says, how do you know what kind of a book is this, or what paper this 1s, I say, in Polish [speaks Polish] It had to rhyme, I don’t know why, because I — my mother always said, we’re going to Jaja(ph), or we’re going to Babcia for their birthday or their Imieniny, their name day. And Jola, you have to learn how to say another poem. So I had to learn this. And I said, why do you read to me? I know how to read. Babcia told me, this 1s this, this is that, and I — what does a child do when you cannot get out of the house because of the air raids? And even if we wanted to get o Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 out, we could only go up on our street, in front of the house. And watch out because when the alarm struck, everybody had to be inside."
83,And there were lots of air raids?,"Oh, rot — lots, lots. Especially — I remember those in ’43, and ’44, quite well."
84,"Well, you know, one of my questions is, what is your earliest memory. But your — whatever your earliest memories would be, they are during wartime.",Yes.
85,"Because, if you’re a baby when the war starts —",Right.
86,"So, are your earliest memories connected to the war, or are they some —",Yes.
87,Okay.,"Yes, just — just to the war. I remember that the first memory that I have is when we were totally isolated from the bedroom of my cousins, from his mother, who was dying of tuberculosis. And in that room was a wind — veranda window, glass, that you — you know, there were shades that you could close and open. Why we were there, don’t ask me, I don’t know. Nobody ever told me this."
88,"Okay. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski ° January 21, 2015","Or maybe they told me, but I don’t remember. This was 1942, so I was barely four years old. And I was always afraid to go to that room, because there was — one wall was the glass, the opposite wall was composite of doors. And later on I found out that books were on one side, and a wardrobe was on the other side. But somebody took something out of it and left a black strip of a — I don’t know, maybe of a — a sash, or something, but 1t was looking at me. And when that black sash disappeared, I said she died."
89,And were you right?,"Yes. Because I told my mother this. And on that night, or day, she died. But I think — I don’t remember to be a child. I always had to take care of one boy, and the other on the other hand. My p — my brother Andrew was on the right side, and Izbisznik(ph) was on the left said. He was older, but he missed his mother."
90,Yeah.,"And I think boys are more babies in the — when they’re younger, they, I’m not sure a little bit later. Not all, but some do. But most of them do."
91,But he was alone. He was alone.,"Yes, he was — he was very much alone, and — and if he didn’t get what he wanted, he — his father oh, by the way, his father was a prisoner of war, taken for - Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 labor. He was in Poland, then he was taken to Germany, and then I heard that he went outside, was he in Holland, or was he in denya — Denmark, I don’t know."
92,Okay.,"But they were — people were talking. This — this I remember at many times Grandma says, oh, Franek(ph) is there again. Or he is moved again. But — but my cousin was very — he was very attached to his mother, and to grandmother. If he didn’t like something, he would lay on the floor and have a tantrum. Only my mother could tell him, Izbiszu(ph), get up. You’re not going to get anything to eat."
93,"So, why — she was targeted — your mother was targeted by the authorities, the Nazi authorities because she was dark, or because she was an officer’s wife?","No, they just didn’t like her, because my mother looked too —"
94,Jewish?,"Mediterranean. Yes, too Jewish, yes. And lot of people that — remember I said my grandfather, her father was of a Macedonian heritage. So naturally he was dark, black hair and slightly slanted eyes. One of my brothers has that feature. So —and my mother would not step by. But the last time, when she was taken to the execution square, as we called it, something happened. And my mother told me she just — she had enough, because he offended her."

He took — that I remember, he took his big glove and slapped my mother and she fell on the ground. There were — it was rubble there, and I know that she had a wound someplace on the side of the head, because ther — the blouse was stained, and we were all crying."

101,To believe in God.,"— believe in God — in God, not zhem(ph) cat(ph), that means Roman Catholic, you'll be fine. They’ll leave you alone. My mother refused that."
102,"So, in other words, she could si — if she would refuse — if she would accept to sign that she believes in God, but she’s not a Roman Catholic —",Right.
103,— that’s okay.,And if she would sign that she is a —
104,Volksdeutsche.,"Yes, that she’s a Volksdeutsche. No. My mother said no, I’d rather die."

112,Too little.,"Too little, and I mean, to dig, shovel all that glop outside, and no. So she was paid certain amount of money for that. She — we knew that, you know, you can purchase for 10 pfennigs, you can buy a day old, two day old loaf of bread, which was much better, more nutrition — more nutritional than — than a fresh bread, because it tasted fine, you know, much better than the old bread. But 1t was gone very fast."
113,Yeah.,"And many times I was the one that would go. And I remember, I was maybe four and a half or so, and I would go. It was not far away, a street away from the 7 Interview with Jolanta Pawlikowski January 21, 2015 place where we lived. There was a bakery, and everybody knew me, because I always had a nice bow in my hair up here, cause that’s — I said, I am going out. Grandma always put her best dress when she goes to church and when she goes shopping, so I have to be dressed properly, too. So I went there, and the ladies liked me.

And when my mother would go to my father’s parents, we would — she would not always take us with her. We would sit, and we would say the rosary, or we would sing, and she liked to sing. So, you know —"
154,"Did you have any other friends, or was it a really closed world.","It was a closed world.
