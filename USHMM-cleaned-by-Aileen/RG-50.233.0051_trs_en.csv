GRUENBAUM, Laura
Re: RELATIVES: ABRAHAM AND HANNA ELLENBOGEN
RG-50.233*0051
June 1992
Rockville, Maryland
Abstract
Laura Gruenbaum, born in 1911, discusses her brother Abraham, who was born January 17, 1908
in Rozwadow. The family built a six-room house outside of Rozwadow about two years before
World War I. Abraham was sent to gymnasium in Czechowice, and then attended university in
Krakow. Although he had the best grades, as a Jew, he was not admitted to medical school in
Poland, so he attended medical school in Prague for a year or two. He returned to Poland and
attended law school in Krakow. He had a thriving general law practice at the family home
outside of Rozwadow for two years before the Germans invaded Poland.
When they learned of the German invasion, Abraham, their sister Hanna, and a brother went to
Russian-controlled Lvov, a four or five hour train ride. They walked and rode on a horse-drawn
wagon part of the way.
Germans later evicted Laura and her parents from their house, and they headed toward Lvov.
“Nobody knows where to go...It was just a terrible thing to live it through,” Laura says.
They found Laura’s brothers and sisters in Lvov, and lived together. After a few weeks or
months, Russians took Laura and her parents from the house, and sent them to Russia. Abraham
and Hanna were out at their jobs. The Russians had given Abraham an office job. He moved in
with a friend.
In 1940 or 1941, Russians sent away rich Poles and others in cattle cars.
After the war, Laura found the woman with whom Abraham had lived.. She told Laura that
Abraham said a man had warned him that the Russians were coming for him. He said he would
not sleep at her apartment that night. Neither she nor anyone else ever saw him again.
