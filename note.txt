Install Ollama: Ensure Ollama is installed on your machine and running locally (default URL: http://localhost:11434). Download the DeepSeek model by running:
bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder

(Assuming "deepseek" refers to a model like deepseek-coder; adjust the model name based on the specific DeepSeek variant you intend to use.)
Install the Ollama Python Library: Install the ollama package via pip:
bash
pip install ollama

Verify Ollama is Running: Start the Ollama server before executing your script:
bash
ollama run deepseek-coder
Alternatively, ensure the server is running in the background.
